I don’t know, you guys probably know how many years better than I do. And I am so excited to start new music! So, it’s day one and we’re gonna share this journey with you,” she explains.</p><p>No explanation as to why she deleted the post, but the genie is now out of the bottle and we can all eagerly anticipate something new from the award-winning vocalist, whenever she decides to share it.</p><p>Yearwood's&nbsp;latest release was 2014's Prizefighter: Hit After Hit, which offered up some of her most-loved tunes plus six new songs. That year also saw her pair with her husband for a holiday album, Christmas Together. However, her last album of solo original music was all the way back in 2007, with Heaven, Heartache and The Power of Love.</p><p>Of course, she has not been resting on her laurels during her time away from the studio. She's a reality show star with the Food Network hit Trisha's Southern Kitchen, and a lifestyle guru who's authored numerous cookbooks and helmed a home collection. Oh, and not to forget, she also joined Brooks on a highly successful world tour!</p><p><strong>See Pictures From Garth Brooks' Current World Tour</strong></p><p><strong>True Story!
