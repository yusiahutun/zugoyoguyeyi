Rebecca McBrain and<a href=# title="Rebecca McBrain" rel="nofollow noopener"> Paul Walker </a>had a short-lived relationship in 1998. A few months into the affair, she got pregnant and gave birth to their beautiful baby girl, Meadow Rain Walker. But Paul was not keen on advancing into marriage, and Rebecca left for Hawaii with their daughter.</p><h2>Rebecca McBrain's background information</h2><p class=align-left>Rebecca Soteros was born in <a href=# title="Rebecca McBrain" rel="nofollow noopener">1974</a>. Her father's name is Mark Soteros, while the mother is known as Julie Ann Soteros. She is her parent's only child. The young Rebecca attended Village Christin Elementary School. After completing her university <a href=#>education</a> and graduating, she started her teaching career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29f7f60421339144.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Mike Tyson's daughter?

She stayed here until she met her late ex-boyfriend. After getting pregnant with his child, she left for California to stay with her baby daddy. Unfortunately, the relationship failed to bloom, and Rebecca returned to Hawaii to resume her former life as a school teacher.</p><h2>Rebecca's relationship with Paul Walker</h2><p class=align-left>Rebecca and Paul met in 1998 and began seeing each other almost immediately. By then, he was just starting his acting career and appeared in TV commercials. It was not long before she announced the good news that she was pregnant.</p><p class=align-left>Rebecca shared the idea that they should get married in anticipation of raising their unborn child in a whole <a href=#>family</a> setup. However, the actor felt too young for marriage. At this time, the actor was 25 years old and still in his career's nascent stages. Since there was no hope for Rebecca to become Paul walker's wife, she decided to discontinue the relationship.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a3c4d93b6c946257.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>April Beth Pitzer's story: Was the Arkansas native found?</span></p></a><h2>Meadow's birth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/29f7f60421339144.jpg><p class=align-left>Eventually, Rebecca gave birth to their daughter, Meadow Rain Walker, on <a href=# title="Rebecca McBrain" rel="nofollow noopener">4th November 1998</a>. This was a uniting moment for the two, and it is reported that the two got back together for several months. However, Paul was still hesitant to commit as Rebecca McBrain's husband. Feeling unsatisfied, again, she moved with her newborn daughter to Hawaii.</p><p class=align-left>Rebecca stayed with Meadow for 13 years. Unfortunately, she developed an alcohol problem, which directly affected their daughter. As a result, she lost custody of her daughter in 2011, and Meadow moved to California to live with her dad. Paul walker's daughter kept hoping that her parents would reunite someday.</p><h2>Paul Walker's death</h2><p class=align-left>Paul Walker attended a charity event called Reach Out Worldwide on <a href=# title="Rebecca McBrain" rel="nofollow noopener">30th November 2013</a>. He was with his friend, former race-car driver, and businessman Roger Roads, and it was a fundraising event for Typhoon Haiyan victims in the Philippines. As they returned from the event, their vehicle accidentally hit a concrete lamp post and caught fire. This was in Santa Clarita, California.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1cd134c43c6ba9c4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Katie Holmes: Tom Cruise divorce story, dating, children, wedding</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Roger was on the wheels of the Porsche Carrera GT that took away their lives. Paul suffered burn injuries and severe trauma, and both men died on the scene. During this period, Walker was rumoured to dating Jasmine Pilchard-Gosnell. The untimely death completely shook Meadow, and Rebecca had to leave Hawaii to be with her daughter and give her the support she needed.</p><h2>Rebecca McBrain's custody case</h2><p class=align-left>In 2014, a nasty custody scuffle ensued between Paul's mother, Cheril Ann, and Rebecca. Cheryl argued that Paul walker's baby mama was <a href=# title="Rebecca McBrain" rel="nofollow noopener">unfit </a>to be her granddaughter's guardian due to her alcohol problem. Reportedly, miss Soteros was arrested in a drunk-driving incident in California's Newport Beach on 18th October 2003. She was also in a similar case in Hawaii.</p><p class=align-left>Fortunately, the fight over Meadow's custody came to a favourable conclusion that would see Rebecca change her life for good. She accepted to participate in her daughter's proper upbringing and had to <a href=# title="Rebecca McBrain" rel="nofollow noopener">enrol in a rehab </a>program to quit her drinking habit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5482574292cc6508.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mary Harvey: The untold story of Steve Harvey's ex-wife</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a3c4d93b6c946257.jpg><h2>Where is Rebecca McBrain now?</h2><p class=align-left>Rebecca now has full custody of her daughter and currently lives in California.
