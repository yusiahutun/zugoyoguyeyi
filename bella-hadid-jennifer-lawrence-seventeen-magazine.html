But there are some photos that it's really weird and we look very similar," she says in the November issue of <a href=#><strong>Seventeen</strong></a>. "People say it all the time. I'll walk onto set and five people will say, 'You know who you look like?' and I'm like, 'Jennifer Lawrence?' Then they'll say, 'How'd you know I was going to say that?' and I'll go, 'Because I hear it five times a day.'"</p><p>While Bella usually rocks a darker 'do, we can see the resemblance between these two beauties -- check out their similar cheekbones!</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/0d/o/2015/10/13/0d8c9ae4b03a59c4869525a621c60144_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Of course, the youngest daughter of <strong>Yolanda Foster</strong> also looks strikingly similar to her famous family members.

"But people still love to compare and contrast us — what's better about her or what's not that good about me — and it's hard because people are really mean. But I'm her biggest supporter, and she's my biggest supporter. We're not competitive at all."</p><a class="media-link image-block__link js-track-link" href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/02/o/2015/10/13/0221abde7e7053eba3e2fcb45209a130_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>The 19-year-old star also has learned to accept that her body isn't the same as Gigi's either. "I definitely gain weight and I'm not naturally thin," she explains. "I'm really self-conscious if I go to trainers, so I just do stuff on my own. I go on the treadmill or do yoga and Pilates if I can."</p><p>Whatever she's doing, it's working!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2JlfnZ7kGlmamtfl7KtuMBmn5qcmZl6q7HNp6CfnaJiuaLD0Z6lnJ1dqLK3sc2tnJ6mXaKuqK3ZoqWeZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
