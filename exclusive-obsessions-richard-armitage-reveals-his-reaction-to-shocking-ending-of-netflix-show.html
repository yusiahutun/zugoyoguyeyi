But, William's son Jay makes a beeline for their place and bursts in on his dad and fiancée wrapped up in a moment of passion.</p><p id=el__2AALCmH data-wc=73>After being shocked about what he sees, Jay ends up walking backward only to fall over the staircase railings on the top floor flat. William charges downstairs to see his son bleeding out on the floor. At this point, Anna walks past the two of them, William sobbing and Jay, taking his final breaths. After attending the funeral and his wife, Ingrid, unsurprisingly demanding a divorce, it's clear William still isn't over Anna.</p><p id=edsYrr1Ta4h data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Obsession: Meet the cast of new Netflix drama including Happy Valley star</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e1cBS4RbI6K data-wc=15><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Richard Armitage reveals hopes of working with Nicola Walker again - 'She is extraordinary'</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/422c718516e7-obsession-firstlook.jpg><p id=eGUFw5k015c data-wc=64>Opening up about the final moments and why William wants to continue his relationship with her, Richard told HELLO!: "William says to her, 'I would do it again,' knowing what the outcome was. <strong>That is such a random, unpredictable fatal event</strong>, that if you were given the chance to go back and most humans, certainly, I would say, 'I would walk away from you.'"</p><p id=eWkoYwDc-Xn data-wc=45>Richard continues: "But he doesn't, he says, 'I would do it all again.'

In a way it gives him like a rebirth, he feels reborn.</p><p id=eCQggVCA8ug data-wc=69>"There's a logical way of looking at it but I can't find it. I had to find his logic but it's not logical. I'm sure there are people out there that have been 'toes on the line' to having this intensity and have walked away, but I think they maybe live the rest of their lives wondering about that person.
