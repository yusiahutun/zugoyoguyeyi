Follow her lead and take the time to pick up trash when you see it rather than walking on by. Delekta also encourages replacing disposable household items with eco-friendly options like reusable paper towels and aluminum straws to reduce the use of plastic and paper.</span></p><p class=p4><b>Laura Issac</b><i>, outreach project coordinator at Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute</i></p><p class=p2><span class=s3><b>Focus:</b></span> Issac leads Harbor Branch’s Keep the Sea Free of Debris program, which teaches local teens about harmful marine debris through weeklong camps.</p><p class=p2><span class=s3><b>Tip:</b></span> A big part of runoff waste affecting local waterways is chemicals found in sunscreen, which is why Isaac promotes lathering responsibly. “Common chemicals in sunscreen affect corals’ immune systems, reproduction, and DNA,” she says. “Florida’s reefs are getting very sick. Use reef-safe sunscreen, which utilizes minerals rather than chemicals to protect our skin from UV rays—plus, it’s healthier for humans too.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.stuartmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2023/06/Local-teens-from-Harbor-Branchs-Keep-the-Sea-Free-of-Debris-program-help-clean-up-the-environment.-Photo-courtesy-Laura-Isaac-1024x768.jpg><p class=p4><b>Mary Jarrell</b><span class=s2>,</span><i> first-grade teacher, and </i><b>Rachael Sharp</b><i>, media specialist, at Warfield Elementary School in Indiantown</i></p><p class=p2><span class=s3><b>Focus: </b></span>Jarrell and Sharp helped lead their school’s effort to become a designated Green School, a program established by the FAU Pine Jog Environmental Education Center. “Due to the pandemic, the program ended in 2021, but our Green School efforts did not,” Jarrell says. The school has implemented green habits like enhancing school grounds through vegetable and butterfly gardens, using energy-efficient lighting, sorting trash, recycling, composting, and collecting clothing donations to be reused for local Dress for Success programs aimed at helping women in the workforce.</p><p class=p2><span class=s3><b>Tip: </b></span>“At home, it’s easy to recycle items instead of throwing them away,” says Sharp. “Don’t throw away old clothes—donate them at a clothing drop-off center. Also, Publix has a drop-off where people can bring their plastic bags so they don’t end up in a landfill.”</p><p class=p4><b>Jennifer Pelham</b><span class=s2>,</span><i> county extension director at UF’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Extension Martin County</i></p><p class=p2><span class=s3><b>Focus: </b></span>Pelham leads training programs via Florida Friendly <span class=s6>Landscaping, a statewide program run through the University</span> of Florida that aims to teach landscaping professionals and homeowners how to reduce pollution while still having beautiful landscapes so Florida’s natural resources are protected.</p><p class=p2><span class=s5><b>Tip: </b></span><span class=s6>“The majority of our work relates to reducing runoff and waste, including stormwater runoff,” says Pelham. “Don’t let anything go down the storm drain but water, especially grass clippings and fertilizer, which can release harmful chemicals into waterways.” Pelham suggests blowing grass clippings and fertilizer away from sidewalks, driveways, and roads to avoid drains. “We also suggest composting grass clippings. If a compost bin on site is not possible, make sure you only put lawn waste out during landscape debris pickup—not on regular garbage pickup days—so it does not end up in our landfills.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tMDUmqmtpZGcrru1zZ5lnKedZMC1wcCrq2akmZuycLvUrZuop6KofHV5xJymZp6inrKvsMuyZKGZkp7BtHnFq6amZaSdsm680aiqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
