But if your project requires hardware options that don't exist on the Pi, then it's time to shop for a new SBC&nbsp;(single board computer). Here are some of our favorites.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keep in mind that the Raspberry Pi has a massive fan community and outstanding software support. This isn't the case with alternative SBCs, which have smaller fan communities and may lose support for software like Kodi as the world moves on to bigger and better SBCs. If you're a beginner who's already overwhelmed by the task of setting up an SBC, it may be better to start with a Raspberry Pi.</p><p>If you're down for the challenge or are a seasoned Pi user who has ideas for a bigger project, however, read on.</p><h2 id=what-to-look-for-in-a-pi-alternative>What to Look for in a Pi Alternative</h2><p>Before we get into the weeds, let's cover a few of the components that you should look out for in an SBC. These components will dictate how an SBC can be used, along with what accessories, software, and operating systems are compatible.</p><p>If you already know what you're looking for, feel free to skip this section. We're just doing a quick review to keep everything straight.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>CPU/GPU/RAM</strong>: Heavy applications require extra power. We'll note when an SBC has an especially powerful board for demanding operating systems, gaming, or heavyweight computing.</li><li><strong>Video Output</strong>: The <a href=#>Pi 4</a> is capable of outputting 4K video at 60 FPS. If you're building a media center with an SBC, know that this is the benchmark.</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi and&nbsp;</strong><strong>Bluetooth</strong>: Some SBCs, such as the Pi 4, are built with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth hardware. This wireless tech isn't necessary for all applications, and you can add any OS-supported wireless adapter to an SBC. Still, it's something to keep in mind if you're working on a mass-media, portable, or IoT project.</li><li><strong>Input/Output Pins</strong>: SBCs sport a selection of I/O pins for expanding device capabilities and connecting accessories (like fans).</li><li><strong>Ports</strong>: Extra ports mean extra accessories! If you plan on using a lot of USB devices or displays with your board, then keep an eye on those ports.</li><li><strong>Storage</strong>: Raspberry Pi computers don't have soldered-on eMMC flash storage or a SATA interface for SSDs (although you can attach an SSD with some tinkering). If you require these high-speed storage options for your project, then buy an SBC with eMMC storage or a SATA interface.</li><li><strong>OS Compatibility</strong>: Are you fixated on a specific Linux distro? Or do you want to install Android or Windows on your SBC? Either way, you'll want to look into OS compatibility before settling on any device. (Pi computers can run <a href=#>a mess of different operating systems</a>, including <a href=#>Android</a>).</li><li><strong>Size</strong>: Small boards are ideal for specific applications, such as IoT projects. That said, larger boards will generally pack more power and offer a wider port or I/O pin selection.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now that we know what to look for in a Raspberry Pi alternative let's jump right into it. Here are the best SBCs that aren't manufactured by the Raspberry Pi foundation, along with some of their key hardware information and potential use cases.</p><h2 id=for-libreelec-or-openelec-media-centers-libre-computer>For LibreELEC or OpenELEC Media Centers: Libre Computer</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10fb15c7-3.png> Libre<p>With its 64-bit ARM processor, 4K 60FPS-capable GPU, 2 GB of RAM, four USB ports, and 40-pin header, the <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Libre Computer</a> (or Le Potato) is practically a direct alternative to the Raspberry Pi 4 (it even fits in Pi 3 cases).

On top of that, it has a full-sized HDMI 2.0 port (no fiddling with converters) and is supported by <a href=#>LibreELEC</a> in mainline builds.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the Raspberry Pi 4 has two Micro HDMI ports and is supported by both LibreELEC and OpenELEC. Also, the Libre Computer doesn't come with any Wi-Fi or Bluetooth hardware (it does have a Gigabit Ethernet port).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/51jwa6hiz0l-_sl500_-1.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title>Libre Computer Board AML-S905X-CC (Le Potato) 2GB 64-bit Mini Computer for 4K Media</h5><span>For LibreELEC or OpenELEC</span><p class=display-card-description>The Libre Computer is a near-identical alternative to the Raspberry Pi 4.

It has a small footprint and low power consumption (with voltage levels as low as 4.0V), and it supports <a href=#>Armbian</a>, the popular OS for lightweight server control.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the NanoPi Neo requires an adapter for Wi-Fi or Bluetooth capabilities. Also, cheap Raspberry Pi products like the <a href=#>Pi Zero</a> cost less than the NanoPi Neo2. A Pi Zero can work for server applications (although the Pi Zero has some hardware limitations and doesn't come with GPIO pins---<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">those are sold separately</a>).</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=#>Buy on Amazon</a></span></p><h2 id=for-running-android-asus-tinker-board>For Running Android: ASUS Tinker Board</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/4f205e48.png> ASUS <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Why run Android on an SBC?
