She had known him since 1956 when they met as adolescents at Shelbyville Mills School. 22 years into the marriage, Locke stated in court papers that it was never consummated and described her relationship with Anderson—reputedly a gay man—as being "tantamount to sister and brother." Locke, testifying under oath to a jury, said that her husband was "more like a sister to me" and explained, "it's funny the sort of cultural changes, but in those days males and females never lived together unless they were married." According to her death certificate, the two were still legally married when she died, and Anderson was the person who reported her death.<br>Locke died on November 3, 2018, at the age of 74 from a cardiac arrest related to metastatic breast cancer that also traveled to her bones, although it was not publicized until December 14, 2018. Her remains were cremated at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary. The ashes were given to her husband Gordon Anderson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZoqqimlKeubrjOnKKeZZGjsW6zzqubqKZdlrulsdGspqc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
