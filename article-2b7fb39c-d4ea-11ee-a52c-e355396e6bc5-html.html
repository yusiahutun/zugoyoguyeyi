The driver reportedly pulled into the parking lot of R&R Rentals and did donuts before getting back on the road and heading back toward town, attempting to ram the police cruiser as he did so, said Sgt. Liz Walley of the Sandersville Police Department.</p><p>“(Langley) did a good job of maneuvering to get out of the way,” she said.</p><p>The officer got the suspect stopped on Old Maid Cemetery Road, but the suspect reportedly refused to step out of the pickup, shouting, “You’re going to have to shoot me,” Walley said. “He then charged at the officer and was ‘Tased,’ then he complied.”</p><p>Before that, Hickson had reportedly struck two vehicles that were pulling into their driveways then “T-boned” a small pickup, pushing it down the roadway a bit before striking it again, Walley said. A woman in one of the vehicles was transported by ambulance to South Central Regional Medical Center for what were described as minor injuries.</p><p>“They’re all really lucky that no one was seriously injured,” Walley said.</p><p>Hickson’s blood-alcohol level registered over the .08 legal limit on the portable breathalyzer and the Intoxilyzer at the jail, she said. Jones County Sheriff’s Department personnel assisted, and Walley expressed thanks for that.</p><p>Hickson was expected to make his initial appearance in Sandersville Municipal Court in front of Judge Sonny Saul.</p><p>In addition to the felonies and DUI, he is facing charges for resisting arrest, careless driving, no insurance and driving with a suspended license.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKaVrMBwstGenJimlazAcL%2FNqJqknaKasW61zWaqmqaUmr%2B0wsilo55nkafBqq%2FLnpZrmmebr3SFwmabbZ2RYn5yscRmmG5qk2KydIGUbHBvnWaXsHZ6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
