The ninth month of the Islamic calendar starts when a crescent moon is sighted in the sky, and ends 29 to 30 days later when the next crescent appears.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The observance of Ramadan is one of the Five Pillars of Islam and barring a few medical and logistical exceptions, all able-bodied, adult Muslims are obliged to fast every day from sunrise to sunset for the duration of that month.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While most people know about the fasting requirement, many are not aware of the spiritual aspects of Ramadan, such as devoting oneself to prayers and recitations of the Qur’an, and not engaging in sinful behaviour.</p>There is an ancient practice in Taoism called bigu, or “grain avoidance”, which is a form of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">fasting</span></a> that involves long-term abstinence from the “five grains”: various cultivars of rice, wheat and millet, hemp seeds, soybeans, and so on.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The best milk substitute for you: soy, oat, hemp, quinoa and more</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For most people today, bigu is practised more for health reasons than spiritual ones, However, there are adherents of Taoism who claim that long-term abstinence from food will heighten their spirituality. In the past, some even believed that fasting could eventually result in one’s immortality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the earliest references to grain avoidance was in the ancient Chinese text Zhuangzi, one of the two foundational texts of Taoist philosophy.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the chapter Enjoyment in Untroubled Ease, it was recorded that “far away on the hill of Gu Ye there dwelt a spirit-like man whose flesh and skin were as ice and snow; whose manner was elegant and delicate as that of a virgin; who did not eat any of the five grains, but inhaled the wind and drank the dew. He mounted on the clouds and rode on flying dragons, wandering and enjoying himself beyond the four seas.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Disregarding the references to his frequent flying on clouds and dragons, it is obvious from the description of this man that by the time of the late Warring States period (479-221 BC), during which Zhuangzi was compiled, there had already been some awareness that not eating “any of the five grains” was beneficial for one’s physical and mental health.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hated by generations of Chinese, their reappearing statues teach not to forget</span></p></a></h3>Long-term abstinence from the “five grains” is not so different to <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">contemporary diets that are low in carbohydrates</span></a>; both result in a leaner and healthier body. Instead of grains, long-term bigu practitioners feed on fruits, nuts and herbs with medicinal properties.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is another way of practising bigu in the short-term that is closer in essence to fasting. For a duration from a few days to weeks, a person would abstain from all solid foods at all times and drink only fluids. At the same time, he or she would meditate, do breathing exercises or practise some form of physical exercise such as qigong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It is believed that by regularly practising this form of bigu, one’s physical, mental and spiritual well-being will be elevated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Whether you are fasting for health or religious reasons, it is important to ascertain beforehand your medical condition before you begin your period of abstinence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In my own way, I practise intermittent fasting by default – up to 16 hours daily – because I usually have a couple of cups of black coffee in the morning and nothing else. I do not know if it is doing me any good. I am still about 10kg (22lb) heavier than I ought to be for my height.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOrJ%2BoqqRiv6atw6xmmqqknrCtsY5saHBqY26FcLjOsGScmaKXeqW1xK1kp6ddp7Kksc2tZJ%2BZlGKwqbXNmqpmrpWnwKq7zQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
