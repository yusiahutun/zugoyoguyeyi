The site appears legitimate and is not a scam, but there are a few red flags to watch out for.</p><h2 id=an-overview-of-the-american-emergency-fund-ad-and-website>An Overview of the American Emergency Fund Ad and Website</h2><p>The American Emergency Fund ad appears on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and other social media platforms. People who click on these ads end up at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">americanemergencyfund.com</a>, where they can apply for a loan.</p><p>The website appears well-crafted and professionally designed. Upon landing on the site, you see the option to apply straightaway for a loan, learn about the types of loans available to you, and read basic loan terms as FAQs. The website has everything needed to help someone easily apply for a loan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/loan-form-on-the-american-emergency-fund-website.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The terms and conditions, lending policy, privacy policy, and everything else a customer would expect are clearly outlined. On the downside, providing all business details clearly and the professional look and feel of the website give us the impression of a genuine loan provider. However, this is not true, and the fund doesn't lend money; it only connects loan seekers with lenders.</p><p>This raises the question: how does the business work, and where does the loan come from?</p><h2 id=how-does-the-american-emergency-fund-website-operate>How Does the American Emergency Fund Website Operate?</h2><p>The American Emergency Fund website is not a loan provider but an affiliate website connecting people with lenders offering loans.</p><p>The website operators clearly state that they are not representing any lender and only collect and forward applicants' information to any lenders they partner with. The disclaimer on the website states that if you do not want your personal information shared, do not apply for the loan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/someone-holding-a-phone-with-the-american-emergency-fund-post-open-on-a-website.jpg><p>Based on this, here's how the loan process goes: you apply for the loan through the website, your data is shared with lenders, and if a lender accepts your loan application, they contact you through the information you provide in the loan application. Following that, the loan process follows a similar pattern to any other loan procedure.</p><p>In essence, the only difference here is that you apply for the loan through a website rather than directly with the lender.</p><h2 id=how-reliable-is-the-american-emergency-fund-website>How Reliable Is the American Emergency Fund Website?</h2><p>Despite having a professionally designed website, which clearly outlines everything an applicant should be aware of when applying for a loan, we have noticed a few red flags.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To begin with, the American Emergency Fund's domain was registered in January 2023. At the time of writing, the fund had just started operations four months ago. This is one of the <a href=#>signs of an untrustworthy website</a>. Since the business has no track record and has only been in business for a few months, it is not wise to be suspicious.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/american-emergency-fund-domain-data-on-who-is-website.jpg><p>Besides that, the contact information on the website indicates that the site is powered by the company TPOLTECH, Inc. However, the company's Google Business listing suggests that this business has permanently been closed. So, one can't be sure whether the business information on the website is genuine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/tpoltech-inc-business-showing-as-permanently-closed-on-google-business.jpg><p>As for the interest rates, ScamAdviser's YouTube channel shared a story of an applicant who applied for a loan through the American Emergency Fund website and was offered $1,500 at 777% interest. This is a horrendous amount that would likely result in the borrower paying back substantially more than the $1,500 they receive. Although interest rates differ among lenders, this example gives some insight into how cruel it can get.</p><p>The same person reported that the lender's phone call was not from a US number. This suggests your data could be shared with lenders outside the United States. Since the lender's interest rate depends on the country it is based, you may have to pay more interest than you usually do in your country.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=should-you-apply-for-the-loan-offer-on-the-american-emergency-fund-website>Should You Apply for the Loan Offer on the American Emergency Fund Website?</h2><p>As you can see from the red flags discussed above, the American Emergency Fund isn't the best website to apply for a loan. Nevertheless, it is entirely up to you to decide whether to apply for the loan offer.</p><p>Here are a few more reasons why we don't recommend this website (or company) to apply for a loan, even if we consider it legitimate:</p><ul><li>Since the website doesn't lend money, even if you apply for a loan, there is no guarantee you will receive the money.</li><li>The loan application requires you to share critical information such as your name, address, employment details, the last four digits of your social security number, and more. To <a href=#>prevent identity theft</a>, you want to avoid providing such private information to a suspicious website.</li><li>The website states that your information will be shared with up to five lender networks, but you never know who they are. If those lenders decide to share your data further, you can do nothing about it.</li><li>The operators of such websites receive compensation from the lenders, possibly for each lead, so you may find a better deal if you contact the lenders directly.</li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to the above reasons, the American Emergency Fund website may not be the right place to apply for a loan. If you need a loan, we recommend contacting a local bank or lending institution with a good track record. While you may have to wait longer to get a loan through this route, such options would likely do a better job of safeguarding your data.</p><h2 id=look-for-reliable-loan-providers>Look for Reliable Loan Providers</h2><p>The loan provider you choose should be reliable so that you can comfortably pay the loan back without having to pay excessive hidden fees.</p><p>Rather than apply for loans through the American Emergency Fund website, look for reliable loan providers who directly lend you money. Take the time to research any loan offer you receive before accepting it and avoid divulging your personal information through random websites.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiYpp2inrCiuoyepJ6ql5q7pMWMn6ynnF2hvKK6jKidn52iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
