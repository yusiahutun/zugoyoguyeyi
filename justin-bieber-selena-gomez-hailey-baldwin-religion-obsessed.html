She knows how much that would hurt."</p><p>The source added: "Selena is kind and the last thing she would ever want would be to be part of trouble in their relationship.

I don’t want to sound wrong, but it was boring.</p><p>"I didn’t care about it anymore, until I found a church I felt was geared toward young people, And for me, that was the Hillsong Church in New York City.</p><p>“Then I developed my own relationship to church and my own relationship with God, separate from being raised that way by my parents. That’s been a cool journey for me.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>The Hillsong church, which has a large celebrity following, is a global organization, with locations across the globe and has an estimated weekly attendance of 100,000 people.</p><p>The Sun has contacted Justin and Selena's reps for comment.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Justin Bieber wishes he'd saved himself for marriage because ‘sex can be kind of confusing'</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hpY2yBeoSXaKGuq6Seu26uyJ6ZnqpdqLKtsc2aZKCnnZrHbrTAoqOesV2Xrq2w1qKlZqqVobaotc6nZKiao5rAtLHDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
