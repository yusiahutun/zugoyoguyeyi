An afternoon spent watching Are You Afraid of the Dark? on a blow-up couch while eating some sort of fruit snack roll-up thing? I'd like to go back now, please. But, while there's no magic potion that can help me travel to a time before bills, commitments, jobs, etc., there is one thing us fully formed adults can still enjoy freely: Kid fashion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to becoming an adult, I assumed I'd have to ditch all my fun clothing and accessories at a certain point. After all, I'd never seen my mom wear butterfly clips or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>quirky graphic tees,</a> and fashion rules declaring what was "polished" and "professional" were everywhere until a few shorts years ago. These days, however, I know that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>trends have no age limit</a>, and anyone can wear anything — especially now, when so many styles I enjoyed as a six-year-old have seemingly been revamped and enlarged to suit my much-older self.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From playful jewelry to puff-sleeves, there's a long list of childhood favorites that now come in adult form. (And, if you're still missing the good ol' day, Are You Afraid of the Dark? is bingeable on Paramount+.)</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-vending-machine-rings></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Vending Machine Rings</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Remember begging your mom for a quarter just so you could plop it into a machine, twist a handle, and get...a really cheap ring that will probably turn your finger green? Well, someone took that idea and ran with it for 2021. Not only are big, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>resin bubble rings</a> having a moment, colorful, geometric, jeweled designs have been popping up, too — only this time around, they're made from quality materials, making them a bit more costly than $0.25.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>Alison Lou Heart-Shaped Pink Sapphire Cocktail Ring; $1,485</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-beaded-jewelry></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Beaded Jewelry</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So much of my jewelry as a youngster was made to stretch, and included tons of colorful beads that came in classic shapes and patterns. While my adult self would never say no to diamonds or a sleek gold chain, I'm also happy to report that beaded designs are back, which are perfect for casual days or times when your outfit needs a little pop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Roxanne Assoulin Cool Calm Collected Necklace</a>; $135</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-novelty-prints></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Novelty Prints</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Remember when I thought graphics would be long gone by my mid-20s? Well, it turns out that's so not the case. Aside from slogan sweatshirts going strong with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>schoolcore look</a>, many brands have started thinking beyond the average florals and polka-dots, decorating dresses, skirts, tops, and pants with animals, food, and specific objects. It's refreshing, and perfect for that carefree summer vibe.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Rachel Antonoff Antonia Top</a>; $175</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-buckle-shoes-and-sandals></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Buckle Shoes and Sandals</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part of me will always look at Mary-Jane shoes styled with socks and think about my collection of dolls, but despite nicknaming the trend "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>babydoll shoes</a>," this footwear option is perfectly fine to wear well into your 30s, 40s, and 50s. They're the flat that complements dainty dresses, and a chunky sole can help amp up your everyday pair of jeans. It's time to work a versatile pair of buckle shoes (and sandals — especially of the jelly variety!) into your go-to rotation, alongside those slip-on sneakers and ankle boots.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Proenza Schouler Lug Sole Mary Janes</a>; $795</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nightgowns></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Nightgowns</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I literally spent years wondering when and why I made the switch from nightgowns to pajama sets (or, let's be honest, sweats and oversized T-shirts I've owned since high-school). But, one positive of staying home all year is that loungewear became fancier — and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>nightgowns and "nap dresses" made a comeback</a>. It's the one-and-done look that works for both bed and activities outside the home, helping to make walking the dog a little more glamorous.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Hill House Home The Caroline Nap Dress</a>; $100</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-overalls></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Overalls</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ok, so overalls aren't really new for 2021 — they admittedly made their way back into my wardrobe around 2016, and I'm immensely grateful for it. After all, why should toddlers be the only ones to benefit from this throw-on-and-go look? Of course, you don't have to pair yours with a onesie bodysuit; a baggy tee and sandals work for relaxed, weekend days, while a balloon-sleeved something and boots will help to make this piece seem somewhat dressy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Long Denim Dungarees</a>; $80</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fun-sunglasses></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Fun Sunglasses</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I'm not sure if most of my sunglasses as a child were just leftover party favors, but the colorful, plastic designs certainly had that vibe. The rest were tinted and very Y2K, inspired by my ultimate style icons, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen</a>. Thankfully, with so many old trends resurfacing, I can re-experience this bold, whimsical fashion choice from my youth, alternating between shockingly bright pairs and some classic, adult-y aviators.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">Crap Eyewear The Supa Phreek</a>; $79</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-elaborate-socks></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Elaborate Socks</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not everyone will be on board with this one, but I don't care. I personally love swapping out my boring old tube socks for pairs that include ruffles and/or sparkles. It's the easiest trick for giving a simple outfit a more fashion-forward spin, and definitely helps spice up my <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>white sneakers</a> and the aforementioned Mary-Janes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>Free People Zig Zag Crochet<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow> Anklet Socks</a>; $14</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-puff-sleeves-and-ruffles></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Puff Sleeves and Ruffles</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_63-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In recent years, my style has slowly become more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>joyful and statement-making</a> — two qualities I definitely enjoyed as a child. I would beg to wear outrageous, sequined, poufy designs for every single occasion, even if it was just a trip to the store. Thankfully, balloon sleeves and ruffles are currently favorites among the fashion crowd, and these tiny details are everywhere — even on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>breezy blanket dresses</a> — adding an element of fun to any look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_65-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>WRAY Rosemary Dress</a>; $264</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bow-details></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_69-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bow Details</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_70-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_71-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's true: I definitely leaned into the girly-girl aesthetic from a young age, and so much of my clothing and accessories featured bows. These days, while I do still enjoy that sweet detail, I prefer it to be more subtle, in the form of a shoulder tie or in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>place of a button</a>. It's something small that helps to take a basic tank or sweater up a notch without being over-the-top.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_73-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now: </strong>Zara Jewel Bow-Button Cardigan; $50</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ykuM6tn6Kml2S4qrCMn5isoJmku27A0Z6lnatdm7yzecCdrKWsow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
