the amount I make on OnlyFans.</p><p>"I made 500,000 AUD the last fiscal year and I made about 17,000 AUD a year before."</p><p>It was during January 2022 that Pamelia realised her chest was growing rapidly, as she had outgrown her most worn bra and she was suffering from back pain.</p><p>Her GP suggested her issues were due to the heaviness of her breasts and referred her to a surgeon who diagnosed her with the condition.</p><p>Gigantomastia is very rare and causes rapid, excessive breast tissue growth, which is why Pamelia went from a J cup bra size to an O cup in just eight months.</p><p>While there have been financial benefits, it hasn't all been smooth sailing for the OnlyFans star.</p><p>Pamelia said: "It causes me back pain, shoulder pain and just pain all over...</p><p>"I have to buy my clothes in plus-size shops and they aren't for people like me.</p><p>"There are lots of clothes and styles that I can't wear because they're too revealing and make other people uncomfortable. I get a lot of looks."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article29942090.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_INSTAGRAM.jpg><p>Gigantomastia can be caused by a range of factors including hormonal changes, medications and autoimmune diseases – but Pamelia’s cause is currently unknown.</p><p>She also suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) so is undergoing testing to see if the two conditions could be related.</p><p>Despite how lucrative her condition has been, Pamelia is planning on getting a breast reduction next year, and would like to reduce her size by about half.</p><p>There is a chance her breasts could grow back to their current size after the reduction, but she is looking forward to having some of her discomforts eased.</p><p>She said: "The money has definitely been something that has played on my mind, but I'm sure that mentally and physically it's the best decision.</p><p>"I will definitely lose subscribers on OnlyFans. I talk about getting a reduction openly and about 70% of my subscribers tell me not to get the reduction.</p><p>"The comments really make me question the decision. They make me wonder if it's the right choice, but I'm sure. Its uncomfortable, and I'm over it."</p><p>Until then Pamelia is planning on saving for another year and hopes to buy a house.</p><p>"Overall, I'm glad this happened to me, because I've been able to open people's eyes to gigantomastia, I'm happy that I've had the experience," she said.</p><p>"I'm hoping to save up for another year so I can buy a house in cash."</p><p><b>READ NEXT:</b></p><ul><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>'I quit pastor job to join OnlyFans – now congregation buy my sexy pics'</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>'I watched porn shot specifically for women – and it wasn't what I expected'</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>'I strip to lingerie to feel sexy – it's not for anyone else's benefit'</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>'Being a porn star isn't what people think – I went a year without sex'</a></b></p></li><li><p><b><i>For more lifestyle stories, <a data-content-type=section data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=# rel=follow>sign up to the free Hot Topics newsletter here</a></i></b></p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKqVlrluuMifnGihXaKupbGMa2xpo12ku63FxZqlrGWRm8GmvoxrcHJuYGWCeA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
