I got it from a teacher when I graduated from Primary Six. Although she bought a hundred of them and gave one to everyone, it is my treasure and lucky charm because it always reminds me that dreaming is the only way to construct a path to the future.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Shen Ruililin, 16, Po Leung Kuk Choi Kai Yau School</span></strong><span type=text>: I have a worn-out pencil that has accompanied me throughout secondary school. This humble instrument symbolises resilience, and it has helped me conquer countless exams and assignments and stood the test of time. It brings comfort amid uncertainties, reminding me to persevere, express myself, and embrace learning, proving that a mere pencil can indeed be a lucky charm.</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">That’ll do, pencil.

It has been a source of luck and inspiration throughout my musical journey. When I first started playing the piano, I didn’t really like it. However, as time passed, I developed a deep appreciation for the instrument. It became an expression of my emotions, and my dedication grew. This brooch serves as a reminder that true growth comes from persistence.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Emily Lee Cheuk-ying, 15, Carmel Secondary School:</span></strong><span type=text> My lucky charm is neither a sparkly bracelet nor an adorable doll. It is a moment spent with a loved one: ice cream time with my father! Before every final exam and piano performance, my dad always gets me my comfort food and has a small heart-to-heart talk with me. It helps me get over my nerves, finish my exams and perform with flying colours. Maybe the true magic of my lucky charm comes from the invaluable love of my dad!</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=6c99662b-8611-49de-bbe4-9ce72a06cd17 data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>Where is the strangest place you found an item you lost?</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Adrienne Fung, 17, Milton Academy (US):</span></strong><span type=text> I have a tiny opal ring I found at a vintage market in Los Angeles a few years ago. I thought the colour would fade over time, but the stone still catches the light and shines like new. Whenever I have a big exam or somewhere important to go, I slip my ring on for an extra boost of luck.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Anson Ng, 12, St Mary’s Canossian College:</span></strong><span type=text> My good luck charm is the four-leaf clover. On my last birthday, my mum bought me a cake and a Pompompurin, a Sanrio character, holding a plastic clover. It was so adorable, and the clover wished me good luck. Moreover, in Primary Three, my favourite teacher told us to do a project about nature, so I took a photo of a four-leaf clover near my home and shared it with my class. My teacher said she appreciated my passion for nature, and I felt so lucky!</span></p><p><span itemprop="associatedMedia image" class="BodyImage__StyledFigure-sc-19n75h5-0 eCNFdy speech-skip-target" itemtype=http://schema.org/ImageObject><span></span><span class="BodyImage__StyledFigCaption-sc-19n75h5-2 fcoAVE">When it comes to lucky charms, the four-leaf clover is an oldie but a goodie.

For the last five years, I have used this same pen on every single exam, including my big A-level exams. That pen somehow makes me more confident, so I now insist on using it for anything important.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Fion Chow Wing-lam, 15, STFA Leung Kau Kui College:</span></strong><span type=text> My lucky charm is a necklace with a cute sparrow. The sparrow represents virtues such as integrity, love and hope for the future. I love wearing the necklace on non-school days, especially when I hang out with friends, because I hope it will bring me good luck. It is also the first necklace I have ever owned.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><a href=# title data-entity-uuid=87b89a18-04c3-4546-9c41-54c6ae3e22da data-entity-type=node data-entity-bundle=article class="BodyLink__StyledLink-sc-1uefa8x-0 cJwLWs"><strong type=strong><span type=text>What is the nicest gesture you’ve received from a stranger?</span></strong></a></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Hylia Chan, 10, St Paul’s Co-educational College Primary School:</span></strong><span type=text> My lucky charm is a plush dinosaur toy gifted by a friend. When I first got it, I kept it close to me, and it promptly began to bring me good fortune. A few days after I received the toy, I attended a street performance, and the host selected me to participate. Despite having to ride a comical bicycle, I enjoyed the experience. After the performance, I was the only one in the audience to receive a gift of a $10 Canadian bill. I feel like I owe this to my charming prehistoric companion.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><strong type=strong><span type=text>Jasmine Chau Tsz-ching, 13, Stewards Pooi Kei College:</span></strong><span type=text> I have a keychain that resembles the drama mask with music notes that brings me luck. I have a lot of drama and music performances, and each one is successful as long as I carry this lucky charm in my pocket. The keychain was a gift from a music coach who was very passionate about performance art.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxrF7w6KqnKemmr9wxc6uqWaun56wpnvAq6uim5yafHR%2BkmlubHBfqbyxeZBpZLCgkal6urvUq2SlrZOgxm6vx5qppmWRo7Fuw8eaq2alkaCytHnIrWSsp12ovaavyJqj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
