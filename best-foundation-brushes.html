Why are there so many? Do I need all of them? Have I been doing my makeup all wrong? Maybe this ocean of brush options for a single product application is exactly the reason why the ever so simple makeup sponge became popular. And although we are indeed fans of the mighty sponge, it’s a foundation brush we turn to when we want precise, even, and blendable coverage.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Trouble is, foundation is not a forgiving friend and choosing the wrong brush to apply it only leads to chaos. Further complicating matters, foundation brushes are not cheap, and no one wants to go buy a bunch of brushes just to discover that they don’t work for you.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’re here to help: We spoke to three celebrity makeup artists to help us cut through the noise and select 24 of the most popular foundation brushes to test on our own skin with our own makeup, judging each one for its design and durability, along with the bristle quality, including how easily and smoothly it blended our foundation on our skin without over-absorbing the product and wasting it, and lastly, the quality of the overall final look after each application.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-saie-the-base-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Saie The Base Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Saie The Base Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kP5w-XfOmWaf1QvKejJJ7ngoURI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/saie-the-base-brush-5c7cd7a048754e0190a5b5fbb38dfc83.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.2</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Between<strong> </strong>the brush’s curved head and densely packed bristles, we covered a lot of ground without using too much product, lending this brush versatility for our blushes and bronzers, too.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We saw a few, very subtle streak marks upon the initial application.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We become gleeful whenever we spy Saie’s trademark lavender-hued logo and lithe typeface, and once again the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>editor-loved</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Real Housewife-approved</a> brand didn’t leave us wanting. It was easy to wrap our fingers around the<strong> chubby handle</strong> as we stamped and stippled out our liquid foundation with the <strong>densely packed bristles</strong>, which picked up product with ease and deposited every last drop onto our skin — no clumpy bristles from left-behind product here. Despite using our favorite semi-sheer foundation for no makeup-makeup days, we were excited to see that the bristles picked up enough foundation to hide things that the it normally wouldn’t, like our brightest acne scars, taking the coverage up a notch from light to a more moderate base with just a few swipes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Moreover, the <strong>slightly rounded brush head</strong> seemed to move with our skin and blended the light liquid foundation evenly across the curves of our forehead, cheeks, and chin, rather than simply slathering the product in one flat layer across our face. Occasionally, we did see some stripy marks when we got lazy and didn’t take time to fully blend the product into our skin with the brush, but we mainly have ourselves to blame for that bit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And though it was small, the brush was quite mighty — we did everything but stomp on it with steel-toed boots, and still it remained intact. Considering this alongside its <strong>compact size</strong>, we’d say the brush will make an ace of a travel partner as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Head Shape:</strong> Round | <strong>Brush Material: </strong>Synthetic | <strong>Designed for: </strong>Buildable coverage</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-elf-cosmetics-ultimate-blending-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>e.l.f.

These design features allowed us to expertly make those small circles required when you want to blend the product into the skin for a diffused finish, rather than smearing the product across it. Finally, no longer did our foundation look like a bowl of Moose Tracks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although not everyone will love the lush round brush head or the airy feel of the bristles (versus a firm touch), we were surprised by how much we enjoyed using it, especially when we wanted coverage that made our complexion look utterly flawless. Plus, it did the job faster than any other brush we tested, since the large brush head was able to cover a lot of real estate at once. This brush is now the first one we’ll pick up when we’re rushing to get out the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing to keep in mind is that this brush is here for a good time, not a long time. After one use we already noticed it lost a few bristles and saw chips of paint flaking off the handle, but hey we’re always down to have an affordable option that gets the job done in our arsenal.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Head Shape: </strong>Dome, tapered<strong> </strong>| <strong>Brush Material: </strong>Synthetic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Designed for: </strong>Buildable coverage<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-liquid-foundation-brush-charlotte-tilbury-magic-complexion-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Liquid Foundation Brush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charlotte Tilbury Magic Complexion Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charlotte Tilbury Magic Complexion Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IZqF50OTvH0SEFcNH-FxmLA44z0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Charlotte-Tilbury-Magic-Complexion-Brush-1f4a296502c94f80a0ed2e265d9f56a0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Charlotte Tilbury</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The ergonomic brush design and airy bristles forbid a heavy-handed application so you get the perfect amount of coverage that never looks cakey.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Since the bristles aren’t as densely packed, this brush is best for light to moderate coverage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the same way that Charlotte Tilbury’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>skin tints</a> give our redness-prone complexions a natural glow or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>body lotions</a> that make our skin feel soft again, this aptly-coined Magic Complexion Brush worked like, well magic. This time, it’s the simple design and <strong>soft natural bristles</strong> on the Complexion Brush that has us raving.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Unlike most other foundation brushes, this one from Charlotte Tilbury has a <strong>looser, fluffier-feeling brush head</strong> that isn’t quite as densely packed. This surprising feature, along with the plush bristles, required a buffing technique rather than a painted-on approach, and it glided across large areas of our face easily, giving us a totally natural, diffused base.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only did the bristles feel like a dream against our skin, but they also held the liquid foundation well, as we didn’t notice too much product sinking down into the base. We recommend this brush especially for those who prefer a light-handed application and a second-skin like finish. Keep in mind that it may require some patience to perfect a full-coverage or high-drama finish using it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Head Shape: </strong>Round | <strong>Brush Material: </strong>Synthetic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Designed for: </strong>Buildable coverage</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-liquid-foundation-laura-mercier-real-flawless-foundation-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Liquid Foundation</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Laura Mercier Real Flawless Foundation Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Laura Mercier Real Flawless Foundation Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TNfufEtFRN_IfQbKNrZxzPbapQc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/LAURA-MERCIER-Real-Flawless-Foundation-Brush-409d166f765a4d2798f1c44c319c0eec.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Laura Mercier</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The impenetrable bristles forbid liquid formula from seeping into the brush and instead they applied just the right amount of product with each brush stroke.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The brush was easy to clean, but took a while to fully dry.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Liquid foundation</a> is a finicky friend. On a good day, our skin glows with a smooth, balanced wash of color primed for blushes, bronzers, and powder. On the flip side, a bad day leaves a complexion riddled with streaks and stamp marks. However, we’re very happy to share that we never had a bad foundation day using the Laura Mercier Foundation Brush. From the soft, gentle bristles to the slanted brush head design, we liked every feature this option offered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the smaller size of the brush head, our routine didn’t take us any longer than it normally would with a larger brush head, simply because it gave our complexion a smooth, uniform appearance right from the start. There weren’t any streaks that we needed to keep blending or a thinner spot that needed more product to make the coverage look flush. Although the bristles felt so silky and smooth that we wouldn’t have minded more buffing or blending, especially since these lush bristles also meant that our skin surface remained irritation-free. We also need to give credit to the triangular brush head that careened around our curves and crevices like a Formula 1 race car driver. And, we’re confident that when it comes time for contouring the sharp angle will make drawing those sharp, supermodel-like shadows easier than ever. Gigi Hadid cheekbones, anyone?</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of our favorite features is the way the bristles <strong>picked up the foundation and held it there</strong> without allowing the liquid formula to become prisoners between the hairs. It seemed to <strong>distribute just the right amount of product</strong>, saving us from scraping goopy layers of foundation off. All in all, if the branded-label hadn't worn off the brush so easily the brush would be flawless, but considering this didn’t impact its effectiveness we’ll let it slide.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Head Shape: </strong>Angled | <strong>Brush Material: </strong>Synthetic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Designed for: </strong>Full coverage, contouring</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-large-pores-real-techniques-expert-face-makeup-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Large Pores</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Real Techniques Expert Face Makeup Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Real Techniques Expert Face Makeup Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TyR06HaOQmb1fzKDJZq4KBiLi6M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Real-Techniques-Expert-Face-Makeup-Brush-ba406de1e7e2481e951bd1e891223043.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The brush’s brilliance extends beyond its appealing rose gold colorway — the shape and size of its head worked miracles to stipple over large pores without emphasizing their texture.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We had to use some muscle to rinse out all the foundation caught between tightly packed bristles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Those of us with large pores are all too familiar with the dread that comes with applying foundation and just hoping for the best with crossed fingers. Large pores dot our T-zone and the area surrounding our nose, and sometimes trying to cover them feels like a losing battle as we watch our foundation slip into the abyss of our pores. After chatting with a few pros for this story, we learned the proper technique to blur their appearance for a more refined-looking texture — starting with the right brush, like this large<strong>, fluffy brush </strong>from Real Techniques that was designed specifically with uneven texture in mind.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To make pores disappear, we used this round top brush to lightly buff product onto our skin and into our pores — it sounds counter-intuitive, but by “filling” them, you’re reducing the amount that will slide into the crevice, ensuring your base looks good for longer. Choosing the right brush is crucial to cover (and not accentuate) large pores and by using a light hand to make small circular buffing motions, the wide, round-shaped brush delivered a seamless, diffused finish.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We found that the bristles were spaced far enough apart to deposit just the right amount of liquid foundation over our textured skin (too much foundation is the kiss of death), yet there wasn’t so much air between them that they absorbed the product. It’s a good thing, too, considering that bristles clumped together when we cleaned it, meaning if there were mountains of foundations in the bristles, it would’ve been hard to scrub out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Similar to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>TikTok-adored concealer brush</a>, it also featured a<strong> stunning rose gold finish</strong> we couldn’t stop admiring.

Limber like a ballerina, the<strong> gold-accented, sleek tapered brush handle</strong> lent it an artistic appearance that simply felt more grown-up and we loved using it each morning. Featuring an old-school tapered brush head, the pointed tip allowed us to easily reach tight corners of our face, particularly the inner corners of our eyes and creases around our nose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although the bristles were densely packed, giving the brush a full, lush appearance, they were very soft and just flexible enough while still providing the moderately firm-feeling application we needed to get the lighter coverage we wanted. What’s more, thanks to these <strong>bendy bristles, they move</strong> in the direction of our creases and crepey areas of skin, instead of catching on these textured areas and emphasizing their appearance. We were also happy that the full brush head prevented too much of our liquid foundation from sinking down into the base.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since Clé de Peau worked alongside highly esteemed Kumano brush artisans to design the brush, we aren’t surprised it was difficult for us to find fault in it, except for that some of the bristles clumped after cleaning it. However, a top-notch brush deserves an equally excellent cleaner, so next time we’ll consider treating it to a rinsing from one of our <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>favorite electric brush cleaners</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Head Shape: </strong>Angled | <strong>Brush Material: </strong>Synthetic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Designed for: </strong>Full coverage</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-sensitive-skin-hourglass-ambient-soft-glow-foundation-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Sensitive Skin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hourglass Ambient Soft Glow Foundation Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hourglass Ambient Soft Glow Foundation Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/AYbR6UlgH_ezr_-V7_1F018f2dU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hourglass-Ambient-Soft-Glow-Foundation-Brush-5d843931b1f348d5a93bb8f27d7cb21f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>This bronzed beauty features cushiony bristles that gently deposit foundation without feeling scratchy or irritating on our sensitive skin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Some<strong> </strong>of the<strong> </strong>foundation tended to get trapped between the bristles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After being scarred (almost literally) in the past by scratchy brush bristles that rub abrasively against our sensitive skin, there’s a good reason we sometimes prefer using our fingertips. However, when we don’t want to make a mess, the next best, arguably better option, is to take advantage of the Hourglass Glow Foundation Brush's <strong>slim angled shape</strong> and <strong>lightweight handle</strong>. In fact, we’ve<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> tested this very product against all types of brushes</a> and it stood out then just as it does now.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One of our biggest concerns with makeup brushes is the level of control it offers because, with one errant swipe, you’ll get a cakey finish that can only be fixed by washing it off. But here, we found that this brush, with its thick handle for a tight grip, gave us the same level of control as when we splodge foundation on with our digits.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because of this ingenious design, even though the bristles were a little more loosely packed and tended to soak up product, requiring us to apply several layers of product to our face to achieve fuller coverage, our final look never appeared too heavy. At first, we did notice a few light streaks with our initial application, but after going back over those spots, we were able to buff them, leaving us with a final look that made our skin look even and natural.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But our favorite part about this brush are the impossibly soft bristles; normally we feel anxiety bubbling up when we need to do a second sweep for additional coverage or go over an area to blend because it irritates our skin, but these were so gentle and silky that not only did we enjoy using it full top, but we didn’t experience any of the redness that sometimes sneaks through when going in with another layer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The only area where the bristles are lacking is that some of the liquid products we used clumped between the bristle hairs, so we’ll be extra diligent when it comes to cleaning the tool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Head Shape: </strong>Angled<strong> </strong>| <strong>Brush Material: </strong>Synthetic vegan fibers<strong> </strong>| <strong>Designed for: </strong>Buildable coverage</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-flat-top-foundation-brush-it-cosmetics-heavenly-luxe-flat-top-buffing-foundation-brush-6></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Flat-Top Foundation Brush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>It Cosmetics Heavenly Luxe Buffing Foundation Brush #6</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="It Cosmetics Heavenly Luxe Flat Top Buffing Foundation Brush #6" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kKK6hmySlNHmXAj1D1gj8olEd_E=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/it-cosmetics-heavenly-luxe-flat-top-buffing-foundation-brush-6-8359d6b9bca14a9a9ad2c66effc18556.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The flat-topped head made for an easy and even application that hid our imperfections and when we needed a bit more product to cover an emerging zit, we used it to dab on instead of a concealer brush.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Since the bristles are jam-packed, we had to rub the brush head a bit more aggressively when cleaning to get it all out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In our never-ending quest to banish flakes from our skin forever, we try to set ourselves up for cake-free success by slathering <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the richest moisturizers</a> onto our skin before using foundation (we love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>this one from Ilia</a>), but it wasn’t until we tried the It Cosmetics Heavenly Luxe Flat Top that we finally got the natural-looking finish of dreams.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although flat-topped brushes can be intimidating to beginners due to their unique design, this one was a cinch to use.

Additionally, the <strong>flexible, lightweight bristles</strong> maneuvered easily around our nose and cheeks and felt so lovely on our skin that we even buffed the foundation over our eyelids — which we never do — to get a good base for eyeshadow.

This way, we’re camouflaging our acne scars, redness, and discoloration, not emphasizing them. We were thrilled to finally nail this technique with this Morphe brush, as we used long, thin strokes to layer foundation brick by brick, creating one even coat on top of the other for a skin-mimicking, full-coverage finish.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although it took a few tries to become acquainted with the handle (it was longer than the ones we’re used to working with), once we got the hang of it, this brush basically did all the work for us as the long, lean bristles blended the foundation into our skin quickly — even around tight spots, including our nose and chin, that tend to require more caution — with minimal waste.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though the bristles came out a little clumpy after a rinse under water, since this brush performed so well and is affordable compared to the others we tested, it's a lot easier to forgive this one flaw.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Head Shape: </strong>Oval<strong> </strong>| <strong>Brush Material: </strong>Synthetic<strong> </strong>| <strong>Designed for: </strong>Full coverage</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dual-ended-brush-elf-cosmetics-concealer--foundation-complexion-duo-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Dual-Ended Brush</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>e.l.f.

Complexion Duo Brush outperformed some of the more expensive options we tried. Its unique design of the tapered handle is hands-down the hero feature. The thin midsection allowed for a strong, controlled grip, while the fatter end, near the brush head, provided a slight pressure that worked exceptionally well when buffing the serum-like foundation into our skin.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, the <strong>handle is also dual-ended</strong> with a thoughtful ergonomic design so we could dexterously flip from sweeping foundation across our forehead and cheeks with the large brush end to honing in with the small-bristled end to reach tight spaces around our nose. These user-friendly features meant that we finished our final look in no time (although by the appearance of our near-flawless skin, you would’ve thought we spent hours perfecting our makeup). Additionally, the spaced-apart bristles blended the liquid foundation in sheer layers, so while coverage was initially light, we were able to quickly build up to a full-coverage look thanks to the round head shape which was optimal for picking up the product and distributing it in smooth, even coats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Given the affordable price tag, it was a delightful surprise that the synthetic bristles felt soft and featherlight as they brushed across our skin. And though they still had enough density to prevent too much liquid from seeping deep into the fibers, we did notice the foundation stained them even after we scrubbed and scrubbed. However, taking into account the helpful features, we still think it’s a great value.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Head Shape: </strong>Dome (both ends)<strong> </strong>| <strong>Brush Material: </strong>Synthetic vegan fibers<strong> </strong>| <strong>Designed for: </strong>Buildable coverage, concealing</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tapered-sephora-collection-pro-foundation-brush-47></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tapered</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sephora Collection PRO Foundation Brush #47</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sephora Collection PRO Foundation Brush #47" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ceBQiz5ZPODeG_7-xS7-BEKZr30=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/PRO-Foundation-Brush-47-e633bdf040f641cb868bd8a32aed073d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The incredibly soft tapered bristles blended foundation seamlessly into hard-to-reach places.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> These bristles like to hold onto product.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We couldn’t stop raving about the <strong>cat paw shape</strong> of the Sephora Collection #7 Foundation Brush.

Still, we’d probably stick to using it with creams because the liquid foundation we used stuck a little more than we’d like to these bristles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Head Shape: </strong>Tapered, dome | <strong>Brush Material: </strong>Synthetic vegan fibers<strong> </strong>| <strong>Designed For: </strong>Medium coverage</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-our-testing-process></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Our Testing Process</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the best foundation brushes around, we spent dozens of hours researching the most popular options; we also chatted with celebrity makeup artists for guidance on what makes a truly excellent foundation brush. Next, we conducted a test in our New York City-based Lab where each InStyle editor applied foundation with the same technique and evaluated key features, including the feel of the bristles, the level of comfort and control the handle offered, and the degree of coverage it provided. We also considered how easy it was to clean each brush and if any bristles shed in the process.The foundation brushes that earned our top scores are featured on this list.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Bristle Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a good reason why every brush on this list features synthetic bristles. As celebrity makeup artist Olivia Barad explains, “natural bristles absorb liquids or creams, which means that you will end up wasting a lot of product.” On the other hand, synthetic bristles hold the product near the top of the head so that the full amount of foundation is applied to your skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Natural bristles also tend to wear quicker over time and become too dry and scratchy to use on sensitive skin, adds celebrity makeup artist Jasmine Adetunji. Depending on the brush synthetic bristles can be just as soft and less abrasive, than natural bristles, making them ideal irritation-prone skin. Even more affordable options, such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">E.l.f Cosmetics Ultimate Blending Brush</a> touts the same (if not better!) plush synthetic bristles as pricier picks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Still, that’s not to say that natural bristles don’t have their time and place, adds Barad, who notes that this lightweight material is perfect for sweeping on powder formulas.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Head Shape</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Foundation brushes typically have four types of head shapes — flat, dome, round, and tapered — and there’s a place and space for each one. A flat or dome-shaped foundation brush head, according to Barad, works best for liquid and cream formulas (rather than a tapered or oval shape) because they’re better at pushing the product into the skin for a full-coverage finish.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Autumne West, the National Beauty Director at Nordstrom, says “I prefer a flat &nbsp;foundation brush and use the tip to blend under the eyes and around the nose, and the flat side for forehead, cheeks and chin.” &nbsp;We loved utilizing the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">Morphe M707 Oval Foundation Brush</a>’s narrow head shape.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Alternatively, a better technique for applying powder is using tapered brushes to layer the products gently onto the skin, says Barad.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Density</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All three pros recommend a brush with jam-packed bristles, especially if you want a full coverage look. “These bristles won’t allow the product, whether it be liquid or powder foundation, to move to the base of the bristles,” says Adetunji, adding that this will ensure an even distribution.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For sheer or lighter coverage, a round or dome-shaped brush with loose, bendy bristles works best, says Adetunji. She adds that brushes with more spaced-apart bristles are best for skin tints, lighter coverage foundations, and for using a powder foundation to set a liquid formula in place. You don’t have to save this brush type solely for powders, however, as West says, “A natural look versus a full-coverage finish is mostly dependent on the amount and type of foundation you use, versus the actual brush, but if you want a more sheer finish with a liquid foundation, I suggest using a loose, powder brush to give you that look.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you apply foundation with a brush?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This depends on the type of foundation you’re using. Generally, says Barad, you’d use the same technique for a liquid or cream foundation, starting with placing a small amount on the back of your hand and “stippling it onto skin gradually” in order to build coverage. “I like to work in thin layers for a more flawless look to make the skin look as natural as possible and add more layers to areas that require more coverage,” she adds.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Barad says that she primarily only uses powder foundations if she’s “working on skin that requires full coverage,” in which case she’ll layer a powder foundation over a liquid one. In this instance, Barad always uses a “press and roll” technique. She says, “I never swipe powder across the skin because it causes the liquids and creams underneath to move, causing you to lose the coverage you’ve built.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, Adetunji also recommends applying powder foundations after any liquid products and using a loosely packed bristled brush to work in light layers over your other makeup. “If you want to maximize the coverage, or use the powder foundation on its own, you can use a buffer brush, which is large and flat, but a little denser than a powder brush,” she says.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What type of brush is best for liquid foundation?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“A flat top or domed brush would definitely work better for liquid and cream formulas than tapered or oval varieties because they are more efficient at really working a product into the skin, which is not really how you want to approach powder,” says Barad.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">West also explains that “while a flat foundation brush can help you layer on product and pat it in, I personally like an angled and full foundation brush, like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hourglass Ambient Foundation Brush</a> for applying and blending, because it is condensed which is helpful to apply with, but it has a soft texture to buff or sheer out the finish.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, our experts agree that with the right technique, any brush can work for a liquid formula. “There are no set rules,” says West. “Sometimes I’ll use a loose brush made for powders to apply my liquid foundation for a sheer look.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you clean a foundation brush?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cleaning your foundation brushes is essential, otherwise, you’re inviting bacteria and grime to clog your pores. It’s good to give brushes you use regularly, like foundation brushes, a thorough rinse at least once a week.
