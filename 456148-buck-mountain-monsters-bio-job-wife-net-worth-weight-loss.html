He has revealed little information about himself on the show. He also appeared seemingly out of nowhere, and thus not much was known about him before that.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION</strong>: Share your outstanding story with our editors! Please reach us through news@tuko.co.ke or WhatsApp: 0732482690.</p><p class=align-left>The reality TV star is not on any social media sites and prefers to keep a low profile. As a result, much of Jacob Lowe's information is not available. For example, he has not revealed his date of birth or where he was born, who his parents and siblings are, and where he went to school.</p><h2>Career</h2><p class=align-left>Jacob is an actor by profession, but he does not have an extensive acting profile. Aside from <i>Mountain Monsters,</i> he has only one other credit, a 2014 true <a href=#>crime documentary</a>, <i>A Murder in the Park</i>. The documentary investigated the 1999 exoneration of death throw inmate Anthony Porter, who had been convicted of a 1982 double homicide.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/dcae333d10dc5c6d.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Ashlee Casserly's husband?

However, the documentary asserts that the investigation to exonerate porter was flawed and that he committed the murders.</p><p class=align-left>In the documentary, Jacob portrays the character Eugene Beckwith, one of the witnesses to the 1982 double murders. His main acting gig is in the reality TV show <i>Mountain Monsters.</i> He is part of the Appalachian Investigators of Mysterious Sightings (the original six hunters in the show), who investigate with the intention of cryptid monsters lurking in the mountains.</p><p class=align-left>It investigated <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">several mythical creatures, </a>such as bigfoot, wolf man, and mothman. Given his brief acting profile, many people questioned the show's authenticity, believing he was brought in to make scripted parts appear more natural. Nonetheless, he won over the fans over time with his big frame and great sense of humour that keeps things interesting.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/4c573e2a12017e87.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Chris Brown's mom?

John Tice, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">AIMS team leader</a>, also revealed that he was sceptical initially. As a result, he was given the nickname "rookie" by the rest of the team.</p><p class=align-left>Despite being a rookie in hunting mythical creatures, Jacob was always willing to do the grunt work. Over time, he also became an experienced hunter and could easily keep up with the rest of the team. On top of that, he is always the first one to jump into any dangerous situation when they are hunting monsters.</p><p class=align-left>As a result, he graduated from his rookie status and was given the nickname "Buck" – a fitting name for his big frame and his headstrong and courageous personality.
