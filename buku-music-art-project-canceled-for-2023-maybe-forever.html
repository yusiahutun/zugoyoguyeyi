In a post on the festival’s website, organizers did not provide a specific reason for the cancellation but noted that the “current model of BUKU needs to take a break.”
The festival, which was founded in 2012 by Winter Circle Productions, hosted a multi-genre lineup of major touring artists and local New Orleans favorites."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It became a homecoming for the most amazing bunch of beautiful weirdos ever assembled and in 10 years, we accomplished exactly what we set out to do: we created a community…a community that truly matters.</p><p>But times are changing… and the current model of BUKU needs to take a break. For a myriad of reasons, we’ve decided the festival will not take place in March 2023. We don’t know exactly what the future will look like – and that’s okay as there is freedom in the unknown – but we know that we will gather again some day, in some form, bursting with creativity and purpose.</p><p>To our Bukrewe, including fans, staff, vendors, local artists, and the city of New Orleans: we adore you. the DMs & emails we’ve gotten over the years say it all…you got engaged at BUKU, you met all of your friends at BUKU, you were encouraged to start a business at BUKU, BUKU was your last show before going into active duty, you fell in love at BUKU, you raged at BUKU, and you connected with a community free of judgement and full of encouragement at BUKU.</p><p>This isn’t “goodbye” – this is “see y’all down the road.” Until then, keep the BUKU spirit alive, keep visiting New Olreans, keep creating and keep loving big.</p><span itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Article class=itempropwp-wrap><span itemprop=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject></span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCam5OawLR6wqikaGpgZ39wfJdoZ25nkqq4tnnMrqqim12Wv7V5z6umo52TqXqkrc2cnKWdlGKzsL6Ma2dra12irrquxGadqKqVq7Kzew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
