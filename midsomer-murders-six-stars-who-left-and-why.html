It has been a joy to be involved in such a long-running series with so many good actors and great storylines.<strong>&nbsp;It's the end of an era for me.</strong></p><p id=ebchtKuHuI3 data-wc=34>He continued: "I suddenly realised that <strong>I'm going to be the oldest detective in the business now</strong> that David Jason has thrown off the mantle. But it was a very difficult decision to make.</p><p id=ej9vGJQ6JmM data-wc=51>"I'll have been doing Midsomer Murders for 14 years by the time Barnaby leaves. I've formed familial ties with the people involved in the show and they will be hard to break. It's always wise to leave people wanting more, rather than be booed off the stage because you bored them."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Jane Wymark – Joyce Barnaby&nbsp;</h2><p id=eKZO-oVD73- data-wc=24>Like her on-screen husband, John, Jane made her debut on the show in the first episode back in 1997 and also departed in 2011.</p><p id=evXt8qUMSxq data-wc=30>At the time, fans speculated that Joyce had been asked to leave the drama due to John's retirement storyline, but the actress said she was ready for a different role.&nbsp;</p><p id=eC1ro6bOcE data-wc=10><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>13 shows to watch if you love Midsomer Murders</a></strong></p><p id=e5j91pSb7oC data-wc=13><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>See how the cast of Midsomer Murders have changed throughout the years</a></strong></p><p id=edyoho8nqKb data-wc=45>"<strong>I'm relieved that I don't have to be the nicest person in the world anymore!</strong>" she told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Birmingham Mail</a>.

I certainly would be if my husband said he was retiring. But John and I have been talking about him leaving for a long time, it hasn't come out of nowhere. And I agree, enough is enough.</p><p id=ei9SdAMnv9V data-wc=19>"I am fond of Joyce but she is very limiting.

"<strong>A lot of the crew didn’t know it was my last episode</strong>," she explained. "The director did shout something like, 'OK, that's Laura's last scene – you can go back to your trailer.

"My complaint is that I'd like a little bit more to do," he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Birmingham Live</a>. "I hate it when Bullard just says 'he died between 12 and 2.30'.

"I was completely burned out from getting up at 4.30 am in Brighton to get the train to London and then on to wherever we were filming in Buckinghamshire, and then doing the journey back and getting home at 9 pm," he told the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Daily Mail</a>. "It was starting to affect my health and I was so tired I was no good to anybody, either at home or at work."</p><p id=eQHFqqd0q_Me data-wc=20>He went on to add: "My doctor told me I was suffering from exhaustion and the only answer was rest."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/eadb2d47bb31-50f81e801097-jason-hughes-ajpg.jpg><p id=eWc0h2MoD3 data-wc=26><strong>Don't want to miss a story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tb3JpYW18rrXDrKamnaJiura%2Bw56prGWjnsVuv9Oaqaxlp528brjEn6tmmZ6Zeri02Gg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
