John went on to say the opportunity may never have been higher or better for Asians to enter the game than now”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Head Master Michael Wolfe on the problem of physique “the game has evolved, and they have designed the rules to promote skilled players” giving examples of players of small stature such as Johnny Gaudreau (who won the Hobey Baker Award for best college player, in the USA) of the Calgary Flames and Mats Zuccarello (Norwegian International) of the New York Rangers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Michael Wolfe also suggested the significance of ice hockey to the well being of a teenager. “The best lessons that you can learn are taught within those activities. Teamwork, working towards a common goal, pushing to a common goal, leadership, all of those qualities can be learned well in a team sport experience.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If you go to the United States, most university counsellors and admissions would say ‘we’re looking for top academic performances but we also want to see what you’re doing outside of the academic community and can you manage both at a high level’. So even from a time management perspective, being involved outside the classroom, whether it is a sport or something else, those are all positive things to have and fill your resume for university application.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the importance of talent: “Raw talent is very important, but it’s the development of that talent through practice over time which makes the most difference.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The scholarship winners for the 2015-2016 school year include three players from Hong Kong (Moses Chang, Preston Kwok, Ruu Kosenen), plus a further 10 for the April Orientation experience.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jordan Laroche, a past KGV student, plays on the Stanstead College Spartan varsity boys team and is the on campus Scholarship Coordinator.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stanstead College is a boarding, university prep-school located in Stanstead, Quebec for boys and girls in years 7 through 12. &nbsp;The growth in interest and the push forward in encouraging and nurturing the elite has been a key part of Stanstead's mission.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvbOx0p6lrZ2UZMCxu9GtZq2noJ6wtHvHqKWgZZuku6h5yJycZqCfmLimxY6aqa2hk6GycH2Xcm5yamlkr6K4wKeaoqaXYraksYyhppyjla56orrDZpydrZOWwaq7zQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
