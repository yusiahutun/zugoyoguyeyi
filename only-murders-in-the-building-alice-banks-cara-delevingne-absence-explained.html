Asked if fans should read much into her absence, he told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>TV Line</a>: "Not too much. We make a one-year time jump there, so there's a bit of a reset.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c0069b1fff28-alice-mabel-art-studio-only-murders.jpg><p id=eWTHgRvoUVx data-wc=64>"We'll have the audience play catchup and ask what's going on with all of them, and what have they been up to without a murder to solve. Each character will have had their own specific journey in that year, and Mabel's journey is probably the most unexpected in certain ways, because Charles and Oliver have been doing the play. Her world has moved forward."</p><p id=e2099INF-ty data-wc=64>He added: "It's all based on where we want Mabel to go that determines which connections hold and who we will see in Season 3. Alice's storyline [resolved itself] in a rather sweet way, with the beginning of a reparation in that friendship [with Mabel]. I like the chumminess that's there. But I don't think we're aiming towards any more of a love relationship."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/82561983e16b-jesse-williams-in-omitb.jpg><p id=e7hWSBOKEm1 data-wc=53>So that's one mystery solved! But what remains unknown, however, is who pushed Broadway star Ben Glenroy (Paul Rudd) down the elevator shaft. Fans have already been discussing their theories for season three on X, formerly known as Twitter, and we think they're onto something! <strong>Warning, spoilers for the first three episodes below…</strong></p><p id=e4XZGSIzuT7 data-wc=18><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Only Murders in the Building: Fans share same theory over Ben Glenroy's killer – and we're convinced</a></p><p id=eVZ7YOloAie data-wc=11><strong>READ:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Only Murders in the Building: Martin Short's family life revealed</a></p><p id=e1-l4r3bZWO data-wc=59>After Ben fell to his death clutching a cast member's handkerchief in his hand, it looked like a fellow actor could be at fault. But, now fans are convinced that Ben's agent and brother Dickie is the real killer. "My theory so far is dickie did it. It would be too obvious if Loretta did it #onlymurdersinthebuilding," tweeted one.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0d29957aab18-paul-rudd-as-ben-glenroy.jpg><p id=eszV50tTHUv data-wc=54>A second agreed, adding: "My No.1 suspect is Dickie. He looks like he is in love with Loretta and might have got rid of Ben to free himself to be her manager." Meanwhile, a third commented: "@OnlyMurdersHulu I'm going with the brother Dickie and the wife is going with Robert with a 'T' #OnlyMurdersInTheBuilding."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ2lsZGh8sLrLsmSmraKZsrO%2FjKKlZqyYmnqjwcilm6Kml2KurbXCnmSbmZ6gwG6vwKuYZpyVobK3tc2gpZ5lkZfAprrCnmSesKChrqq6xJ1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
