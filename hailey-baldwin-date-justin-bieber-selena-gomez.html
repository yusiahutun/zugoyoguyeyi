By August 2016, the two had split. From November 2017 to March 2018, Justin rekindled his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relationship with Selena</a>, whom he dated on and off since 2010. After his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">split from Selena</a>, Justin got back together with Hailey in June 2018. The two confirmed in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Vogue</a> in February 2019 that they rekindled their relationship at a church conference in Miami.</p><p>“The common denominator, I promise you, is always church,” Hailey told Vogue at the time. “By then we were past the drama. I just gave him a hug. By the end of the conference, he was like, ‘We’re not going to be friends.’ I was like, ‘We’re not?'”</p><p>The two got engaged in July 2018 and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">married two months later</a> in September 2018. In episode on her and her husband’s Facebook Watch show, Live With the Biebers, in May 2020, Hailey opened up about<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> feeling “less than”</a> from fans <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">comparing her to Selena</a>.“I’ve had a really, really hard go and a really hard time with a lot of the things people say and a lot of the ways that I feel like people have made comparisons and put me in a position where they’ve made me feel like less of a woman,” Hailey said at the time.</p><p>She continued, “It’s not easy when people have fans that are really passionate and want to express their opinion, and a lot of the time it’s a lot of children and just young people who would never understand the reality of a relationship yet cause they’re so young they haven’t experienced it yet.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/entertainment-newsletter-banner.jpg alt="New Entertainment Newsletter" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2iblaGyo77IrbBmppWswHB9kHBtb2xjZLWitcuesGaakaGxuLXNZpuarJVit7a%2F06KlZpqZmq%2BmvoysnKWdnpZ6qLvMnrFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
