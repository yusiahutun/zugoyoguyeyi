G.H. Bass is an American loafer manufacturer that’s been around since the 1870s and remains the standard in loafers. The slip-on shoes are handsewn in El Salvador and feature stitched moc toes with small heels and stiff leather uppers. While you can expect a little bit of a break-in period to get these to peak comfort level, it will be well worth it. These shoes are ones you can easily dress up or down and hold onto for years to come, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–11 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-free-people-liv-penny-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Free People Liv Penny Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Free People Liv Penny Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BCz9OnqWWpo--gjH464nrWfD9O0=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Free-People-Liv-Penny-Loafer-a52e19205084473f848fcacacee82c2f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Free People</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The range of colors means you can go bold or classic.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Reviewers say the shoe is a little stiff.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Free People plays up the penny loafer motif by adding a metallic button in the place where a penny might usually sit. We love that this loafer style comes in a range of colors from classic neutrals to playful pops of color. A slightly chunky sole adds a little bit of a fashion-forward touch without straying too far from the traditional silhouette. We chose this loafer as our best budget pick at $128 because it's a great value for a loafer that is still made of leather. If you’re interested in growing a whole collection of loafers, we suggest picking up a pair in black and then adding in something unexpected like green or pink.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 6–11 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 7 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-charles--keith-gabine-leather-loafers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Charles & Keith Gabine Leather Loafers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Charles &amp;amp; Keith Gabine Leather Loafers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/uEEvRcX-uJ3Vx5kQUzjt8AhvC9U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Charles--Keith-Gabine-Leather-Loafers-23fd77ac877a49e9807476742a4e11c2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Charles & Keith</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The square toe is great for those with wider feet.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The leather doesn’t look as luxe as other styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">New York City-based podiatrist Dr. Miguel Cunha suggests these loafers from Charles & Keith as a favorite. “These classic silhouette loafers are made of high-quality genuine calf leather with interlocking U-shaped buckles,” he explains, calling them durable, timeless, and versatile. The square toe box allows your feet to fit in comfortably while the 3cm heel adds a slight lift without causing any discomfort. If your style is more classic, we say stick with the black shoe, but if you’re looking for something bold, the brand also offers a loafer in a black and white jacquard fabric that’s bound to stand out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–11 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-classic-tory-burch-classic-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Classic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tory Burch Classic Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Tory Burch Classic Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JO4EeQ3pHIYPGmHExR7Mbrcg-kA=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Tory-Burch-Classic-Loafer-78a33043a87643baae980716059622db.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tory Burch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The simple silhouette can be dressed up or down.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It runs small and narrow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Tory Burch’s most famous shoe may be the brand’s signature ballet flats, but the preppy-leaning label’s loafers are a favorite if you’re looking for a simple, classic silhouette. The Classic Loafer is offered in both classic black and a soft brown color, year-round neutrals that you can easily dress up or down no matter the month. Scalloped details add a subtle surprise to the otherwise clean lines of the shoe, which is finished with the brand’s double-T logo. The shoe comes in a wider range of sizes than other brands, but it does tend to run both small and narrow, so it may be worth sizing up when you shop.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>4–13 |<strong> Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Material: </strong>Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-gucci-1953-horsebit-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gucci 1953 Horsebit Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gucci 1953 Horsebit Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/p17pJwT7gt9bEkxR3FoVhBDZUY8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Gucci-1953-Horsebit-Loafers-18f63bf9610a43d48baac762ce078178.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gucci</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The iconic Horsebit loafer is a timeless style.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Since the style is so recognizable, it’s not for those who want under-the-radar footwear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">First released in 1953, Gucci’s Horsebit loafers continue to be a favorite footwear pick among stylish women and men looking for a pair of classic leather shoes. The silhouette is that of a traditional loafer, with a leather upper and a rounded moc toe, but the addition of a metal horsebit across the front of the shoe makes it unmistakably Gucci. A cushioned sole means that you can spend all day on your feet without the aches that come with thinner shoes. If you’re looking for a timeless style you’ll not only wear for years to come but pass on to the next generation, this is it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> IT35–IT42 | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-colored-sebago-dan-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Colored</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sebago Dan Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Sebago Dan Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/c4175LYnmiqHjfFqbxWKZwZPzUs=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Sebago-Dan-Loafer-d35717548ee44a76b35c1045ccc8484c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sebago</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> This simple silhouette is a classic.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The purple color may not be for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This classic low-cut loafer silhouette by Sebago is hand-sewn and made of smoothed leather. The brand, which was founded in Maine in the 1940s has a long history of making classic loafer silhouettes, but this bold purple colorway puts a twist on a simple shoe. We also love that the style has a leather base with a rubber heel for slip-proof durability. “I love how this purple color pops when I wear my favorite denim-on-denim looks,” stylist Ryan Gale says. Also, consider styling your loafer with a black slip dress to let the shoes really pop.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–11 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-everlane-the-modern-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Modern Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Modern Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/utCgE-FdSplJJfXbFIGpoh5HM0o=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/07b25610-27a2-42f8-b951-449b2fc6b876-5f9e93e8dbe949408ae35db7d611dca0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It’s a sleek, minimalist silhouette that goes with everything.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The shoe can feel a bit stiff.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the minimalists who want a loafer that keeps things simple, there's Everlane’s Modern loafer — a sleek style that lacks the ornamentation of other styles in this guide. The toe has a slightly pointier shape, which adds a dressy touch to the overall look, while the low, stacked heel leans into the vibe, too. If you’re planning to log some serious miles in your shoes, these are also designed with foam cushioning in the insole and wearers report that there’s no break-in period before they’re comfortable enough to wear all day.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Material: </strong>Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-heeled-marc-fish-machi-leather-block-heel-loafers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Heeled</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Marc Fish Machi Leather Block-Heel Loafers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Marc Fish Machi Leather Block-Heel Loafers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/vi-dvLPnUc7aMOvVq0iSZxtfPx8=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Marc-Fish-Machi-Leather-Block-Heel-Loafers-e7fa6b6139194713b02f2c75abe78937.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Saks Fifth Avenue</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It's a great loafer for dressy occasions.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It's not as easy to walk in as a lower style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ready to swap your usual heels for a little something unexpected? These heeled loafers are well suited to the office or dressy settings when you want some lift. The stacked heel and platform add about 3.35 inches of height at their highest point. The shoe still features the signature details of a loafer, like the hardware on top, moc stitching, and squared toe but is more of a hybrid between a traditional loafer style and a stiletto or platform pump. If you’ll be doing much walking, it's not what we’d recommend, but for days when you can sit, relax, and look fancy, these shoes will fit the bill.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-platform-coach-leah-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Platform</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Coach Leah Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1002 data-sizes=750px alt="Coach Leah Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/p5rpSCRdZScOTNKms7UFRYVhtTI=/fit-in/1500x1002/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Coach-Leah-Loafer-e93b18c036cc4d2185452c140f6262ee.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Coach</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The style comes in multiple widths for men and women.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Some wearers report creasing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">New heights are achieved in these platform loafers from Coach, which have a 1-inch lift, perfect for an everyday shoe when you want to sneakily (and comfortably) look taller than you already are. One thing we love about these shoes is that though they are denoted as for women, they also come in a men’s width meaning that you and a friend, partner, or sibling could choose to match if you so desire. With four neutral color options, choose the hue that best suits your personal style and needs. Black is great for work or dressy occasions while brown or white are both great for adding a little something special to summer ensembles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–11 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Material</strong>: Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-statement-mango-metallic-loafers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Statement</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Mango Metallic Loafers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Mango Metallic Loafers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sWSxcPGIXDal_xbNO1I65X-h_BM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Mango-Metallic-Loafers-cc19f286d2a846cf91d9106544cdfedf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Mango</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They are minimalist but still bold.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Glued-on soles may degrade more easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With the holiday season around the corner, dare to let your shoes shine with a pair of Mango’s bold gold loafers. We love that even at the affordable price of $100, they are still made of leather, which remains sturdy and durable through multiple wears. It has a simple round-toe silhouette punctuated by understated hardware and a flat heel. We envision using these shoes to punch up a pair of black jeans or paired with a bold velvet dress for your company’s end-of-year soiree. Either way, these shoes will stand out from the crowd.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–10 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lug-sole-madewell-the-bradley-lug-sole-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lug-Sole</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madewell The Bradley Lug-Sole Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Madewell The Bradley Lug-sole Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/F3RyI4-0DA0uJz1IgAJNl4Lph4Q=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Madewell-the-Bradley-Lugsole-Loafer-in-Leather-b4b569bf041a47dda7af31e9efc6291d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Madewell</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The lifted sole adds height without the pain of a heel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The shoes may be too heavy due to the chunky soles, and reviewers report tricky sizing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Add some height to your look with a pair of chunky lug-sole loafers that offer more traction and lift than other styles in this list. While loafers may not be the ideal shoe style for inclement weather, these are the best of the group for it. While the lug sole has plenty of positives, it is worth noting that it can be a bit clunky, so if you tend to trip easily, just keep that in mind. We love the sleek metal bar detail across the front as a unique take on loafer hardware, think of it as jewelry for your feet.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–11 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-driving-rothys-the-driver></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Driving</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rothy’s The Driver</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Rothy&amp;acirc;s The Driver in Navy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/UIld1IHynuvQ-_rnoQAGNFKZUrc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rothys-The-Driver-in-Navy-354c08ae4e34460f8fa88bfcde2f93ce.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Rothy's</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> They're machine washable.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> There’s no leather option, only fabric.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A driving loafer is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>slip-on shoe</a> that unsurprisingly, is designed to protect you while you’re behind the wheel. Details like rubber grommets allow for grip, while a soft, flexible body promotes adroitness. Rothy’s shoes are made from recycled plastic bottles, which we appreciate, but would also be interested in a style offered in leather as well. One nice thing about the materials used though, is that they’re machine washable. How’s that for easy wearing? They’re not designed to have much stretch so make sure the fit is comfortable when you first purchase them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–13 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 18 | <strong>Material:</strong> Knit fabric made from recycled bottles</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-penny-maguire-tuxedo-penny-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Penny</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Maguire Tuxedo Penny Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=999 data-sizes=750px alt="Maguire Tuxedo Penny Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/rgl0fpmKUvRNB-6m53NcrzFZ55k=/fit-in/1500x999/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Maguire-Tuxedo-Penny-Loafer-2e58c9b1ac6c4184bacc8221a30bf4cb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Maguire</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The black and white design has a dressy twist.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> You may need to size up for wider feet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A favorite of Gale, this tuxedo-inspired contrast loafer is made to break out for fancy occasions. Handmade in Italy, this loafer features a streamlined shape that’s minimal and elegant all at once. We love the idea of styling this two-tone black and white shoe with a pair of bold socks to add a little extra flair. Wear them with a suit to complete a dressy look sans heels, or use them as a way to add a little extra formality to jeans and a tee. Bottom line, you’ll find plenty of ways to wear these.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> EU35–EU42 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-horsebit-carmina-womens-horsebit-loafers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Horsebit</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Carmina Women’s Horsebit Loafers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Carmina Women&amp;rsquo;s Horsebit Loafers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_Q8_-wL14ObxLzAwOQFeYaY5Q1w=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Carmina-Womens-Horsebit-Loafers-4fb7c63b25264f43a0e66a7a615a2d54.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Carmina</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> It’s a high-quality design, handmade in Mallorca.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Leather soles can be slippery and need proper care.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Can you point to Mallorca on a map? Whether it’s a yes or no, you’ll want to have this tiny island on your radar because it's the home of Carmina, a footwear brand first founded in 1866. The shoes are still manufactured there out of high-quality leather. While they may at first be a bit stiff, once you break them in, the soft shape will remain in good shape for years to come. This timeless horsebit silhouette feels detailed but not flashy. If you’re looking for a solid everyday option, this is one of our favorites.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> UK2.5–UK9.5 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-patent-reformation-ani-ruched-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Patent</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Ani Ruched Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Ani Ruched Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/j62BzKKc6AmNNmIL321zApadANc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Ani-Ruched-Loafer-321ae5f7074c45a789c78bed92aaf92b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Reformation</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The crinkle texture is unique.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The style tends to run large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a block heel and a round toe, Reformation’s Ani loafer is “a great example of a classic shape,” according to stylist Jordanna Sharp. “These would pair well with denim, straight-leg pants, mini dresses, or skirts and the patent effect adds an interesting element.” The shoe has a 25-millimeter heel for a slight lift and a crinkled patent leather upper that adds an unusual textured look to the shoe overall, great for a neutral style with a little pop. One thing worth noting: the shoe tends to run a little large, so try going down half a size.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–11 | <strong>Color:</strong> 2 | <strong>Material:</strong> Crinkled patent leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-suede-margaux-the-penny></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Suede</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Margaux The Penny</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Margaux The Penny" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/B39UBFONKIsnmR6UQl8bfUv7rPg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/margaux-the-penny-229e745b1d754ae3867835ab96d4f7f9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Verishop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The suede is soft and supple to the touch.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Suede can require more care than leather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The everyday penny loafer is reimagined thanks to Margaux, this time in a soft suede material. The shoe’s pointed toe is a bit more feminine than other options on the list, and the brand’s wide range of color options creates an opportunity to find something tailored to you. The brand also offers a very generous range of sizing from three up to a 14, as well as in narrow, medium, and wide, so for all the women who struggle to find shoes that fit, here’s an option that may be your Goldilocks find.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 3–14 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 9 | <strong>Material:</strong> Suede</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tassel-zara-tassel-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tassel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Zara Tassel Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Zara Tassel Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/PiHU0R0MyPNi8bvKacWa4-0hlMg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Zara-Tassel-Loafer-3633a33d5740479793ca70082f4d79fd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zara</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The tassels won’t get in the way.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The shoes aren't made of leather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Zara is a go-to locale for trend and affordable basics, and in the case of loafers, it's no different. These playful tassel loafers feature a metallic buckle and black tassels that fan out towards the toe. If you’re a trend-motivated shopper looking for a short-term purchase, these are great. But, since they’re made out of polyurethane instead of leather, ultimately they may not last as long as some of the other shoes on this list. That being said, at $50, it’s a great deal for a pair of shoes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–11 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material: </strong>Polyurethane</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-square-toe-vagabond-dorah-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Square-Toe</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vagabond Dorah Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vagabond Dorah Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/12Vzd8th0Yy7yXRShSM9rP5gH2c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Vagabond-Dorah-Loafer-0c3525c9442442509e626aed0716515e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Vagabond</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The chunky silhouette is a fun statement style.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It’s not as timeless as a more classic silhouette.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Gale is drawn to Vagabond for the brand’s classic colors and styles that “can be paired with lots of things.” These square-toed loafers are chunky, with a platform sole and block heel that nod back to the styles popular in the ’90s. We love the variation in the polished gray leather colorway, which looks black from far away, but up close gives the appearance of being slightly worn in, like you’ve loved them for years already. The upper is made from Italian leather while the outsole is made from thermoplastic rubber, a popular material used in the soles of shoes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> EU35–EU42 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-white-flattered-sara-leather-loafers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best White</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Flattered Sara Leather Loafers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Flattered Sara Leather Loafers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VwnPvzqRmz4YTacKGAfCviQdvUM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Flattered-Sara-Leather-Loafers-027c5fee08234ea7ba9c051c11ff4eaf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Moda Operandi</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The sleek white shoe goes with everything.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> The narrower toe may not be suited to wider feet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s a common misconception that white shoes show dirt easily. In fact, they can be a great versatile shoe that looks sleek and spot-free (and if they do get dirty just need a little dab with a wet cloth). “I love this white shade for this style of shoe,” says Sharp. “It will work across multiple seasons too. Pair with darker tones for winter and lighter tones for spring.” Made in Spain, Flattered loafers are made from soft vegetable-tanned leather, so you won’t have to worry about a break-in period when you’ve bought them brand new.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>IT35–IT41 | <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-summer-st-agni-macrame-loafer></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Summer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>St. Agni Macrame Loafer</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="St. Agni Macrame Loafer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2L2Q6xYEgKEo-fz0OVObrGaxuIw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/St.-Agni-Macrame-Loafer-4745a179a0c247fcb0fa473fba6a9872.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Net-A-Porter</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The woven style is breathable and lightweight.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> It can’t get wet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve happened to experience the feeling of spending an entire day with hot, sweaty feet stuck in a pair of leather shoes, you know that it's not pleasant. St. Agni’s take on the loafer is an alternative that will allow your feet to catch a cross-breeze when you wear them. Though they’re still made of leather, they feature a macrame open weave that lets your feet breathe. The square toe shape and soft body also avoid any rubbing or discomfort that might come with swollen feet in the warmer months. If you have a vacation coming up, these shoes may be your new favorite accessory.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> IT35–IT42 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind&nbsp;</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Leather is the best material for a long-standing loafer,” says Gale.
