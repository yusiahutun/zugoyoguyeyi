During a 2018 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, RedOne discussed meeting the singer for the first time. “At that time, I just did my first hit with Kat DeLuna called ‘Whine Up,'” he recalled. “After that hit, I told my management that I wanted to work with established artists.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_57>“But they called me and said, ‘Hey, we [want you to work with] this girl. She’s talented if you want to meet her for five minutes,'” RedOne continued. “I met her outside of the Sony building in New York, and I liked the vibe I was getting! She was like, ‘Oh my God, I love ‘Whine Up!'”</p><p id=par-5_34>RedOne and Gaga created the song “Just Dance” together. RedOne wanted the song to sound like a <a href=#>rock</a> tune made with synthesizers instead of guitars.
