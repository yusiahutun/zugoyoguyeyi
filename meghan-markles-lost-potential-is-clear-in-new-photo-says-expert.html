This week, <a href=#>Queen Consort Camilla</a> was joined by a group of young campaigners from the charity SafeLives, which one expert says should have been Meghan’s rule in the <a href=#>royal</a> family…</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-978626452-729x1024.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-this-should-be-meghan>‘This should be Meghan’</h2><p>After the event, the Queen posed with four of the organization’s young Changemakers. “Looking at it, the very first thing I thought was, this should be Meghan,” royal expert Daniela Elser <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a> for NewsAU.</p><p>She goes on to say “a member of the royal family welcoming young women fighting to tackle violence against women into the palace and advocating for their work,” is actually what anyone would have predicted for the Duchess when she joined in 2018.</p><p>However, it all went downhill in 2020, when the <a href=#>couple</a> up and left, and that’s when Camilla, stepped up. In 2020, she became a patron of SaveLives and has also recently hosted a reception at the palace to highlight the U.N.’s annual 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence, just to name a few.</p><p>“The Queen is the unsung feminist hero we never knew we needed or actually, you know, had,” Elser writes. Although she says it’s ‘hard to wrap your head around,’ she states Camilla has become “a loud, proud voice for women and girls.”</p><p>According to the expert, Meghan had “So much promise, so much good intent, so much sound and fury which has so far not exactly signified all that much.”</p><p>Although she still does work with the Archewell Foundation, Daniela writes, “I don’t mean to diminish this all as it is valuable, good work, but it’s a question of scale, convening power, and follow-through.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/04/GettyImages-2147857078-1024x683.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-duchess-reveals-her-first-product-from-new-lifestyle-brand>The Duchess reveals her first product from new lifestyle brand</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Looks like Delfina received her American Riviera Orchard package too 👀🤍✨</p><p>Look at the embroidery detail on the lid !!🫠🤍 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/k4B0jT76Bn</a></p>— Iris 🦆 (@IrisTheeScholar) <a href=#>April 16, 2024</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>At the moment, it seems like Meghan’s main focus is on her new lifestyle brand, <a href=#>American Riviera Orchard</a>.</p><p>When she announced the new venture back in March, she was keeping the details on the down low, but now it’s been revealed the brand has sent out jars of strawberry jam to influencers across the US.</p><p>The label of the sweet treat featured the brand name, along with Montecito, where she and her husband reside.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlsX2aFcLnEoJ%2Bapl2irrO3y56qZqSfqMFuvM6tnKesmZa5brXSZpqlnZGneqq6jKecsGWgnby1u4ysmLKrXZrFsbHRrWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
