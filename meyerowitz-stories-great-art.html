‘If he isn’t a great artist, that means he was just a prick.” That contribution to the art versus morality conversation is delivered ungoofily by Adam Sandler, playing Danny Meyerowitz in Noam Baumbach’s Netflix film The Meyerowitz Stories."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The great artist who is otherwise just a prick is Danny’s father, Harold, played by Dustin Hoffman with considerable insight into just what a prick an artist can be. A prick not only unto others, but unto himself: every appraisal of his work either the promise of recognition or an insult; every encounter an occasion for a tiny triumph or an unbearable repudiation; every mention of his work an impossible excitation or an injury to skin so thin, you could blow bruises on it.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>The Meyerowitz Stories is an excruciating watch for anyone who aspires to make great art, whether they succeed or not. There is a little or a lot of him in every artist. Don’t ask me why; it must have something to do with the will to creative exposure: the strange, contradictory impulse of the over-sensitive to offer themselves up on the altar of judgment to people for whom they have no regard.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Compare and contrast the film <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Maudie</a>, which is also about an artist. Maudie recounts the real-life romance between an awkward and arthritic painter and an ill-tempered recluse who has never knowingly looked at a painting in his life. This film also has its excruciations, but they relate more to the gaucheries of love than to aesthetic ambition.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>In fact, no two artists could be more different. Harold fabricates sterile, abstract sculptures that reek of secondhand modernist self-consciousness. It might be a tragedy for him that he can’t get a major exhibition, but he doesn’t deserve one, the prick. Maudie (<a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Sally Hawkins</a>, wonderfully beguiling as the Canadian folk-artist <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Maud Lewis</a>) is as far removed from high-art pretensions as it is possible for an artist to be. “The whole of life, already framed, right there,” she says, looking out of a window at her inspiration: pussy cats, leaping Bambis, red cottages in green fields.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Given the choice, I’d rather have a Maudie on my wall than a Harold on my desk. Her work might be simplistic – barely art at all, if you’re a curator at Tate Modern – but at least it is not the airless, self-important thing of blighted dreams that Harold’s is. If that’s an abrogation of critical seriousness, receive it as my parting gift on this final page of my stint as stand-in diarist. I don’t think <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">Clive James</a>, in whose immense shadow I have written these last six months, would take my preference amiss.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaJqfpLi0e5FpaHFnmpa7cH2SaKSesZWnvLi107NkrKyfp7amv4ygqZ6ZpGKus8A%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
