Louis Vuitton’s Go-14 top-handle bag was practically made for those “What’s in your bag?” videos, with enough space in its pillowy interior to carry around your entire life and then some. And of course there are the bags like those seen on the runway at Ferragamo, quite literally larger than life.

But carrying a large elongated bag perched in the crook of your elbow or clutched tight against your heart sends an entirely different message.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Toting your accessories around in a bite-size package is a flex that demonstrates how you don’t really need to lug anything around.

In February, models at Loewe, Ferragamo, and Coach carried bags so large, they sometimes touched the runway itself.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Carrying around an oversize bag is the easiest way to look like an Olsen twin, and the reason Mary-Kate and Ashley likely love the look is that it adds instant mystique. People will look at you and wonder, Why exactly does she need a bag that large? And who doesn’t like the thought of a look that truly piques others’ interest, even if all you’re carting around is a small wallet and a lip tint (although the most Olsen thing to do would be to stuff the bag to the brim and then spill some wine on it).</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Fall 2023 Trend: Top-Handle Bags That Mean Business</h2><img alt="seoul, south korea april 29 a model walks the runway during the louis vuitton pre fall 2023 show on the jamsugyo bridge at the hangang river on april 29, 2023 in seoul, south korea photo by justin shingetty images" title="Louis Vuitton Pre-Fall 2023 Show In Seoul - Runway" width=2438 height=3657 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1486291876-64ecf5c4d255d.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Louis Vuitton</span></p><img alt="paris, france march 08 editorial use only for non editorial use please seek approval from fashion house a model walks the runway during the chanel womenswear fallwinter 2022 2023 show as part of paris fashion week on march 8, 2022 in paris, france photo by victor boykogetty images" title="Chanel: Runway - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear F/W 2022-2023" width=3805 height=5704 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1239024609-64ecf6307e9d8.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Chanel</span></p><img alt="new york, new york february 12 a model walks the runway at the puppets and puppets show during new york fashion week the shows at 1 centre street on february 12, 2023 in new york city photo by fernanda calfatgetty images" title="Puppets &amp;amp;amp; Puppets - Runway - February 2023 New York Fashion Week" width=4128 height=6192 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1465357536-64ecf5fe5dc7c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Puppets & Puppets</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s something undeniably powerful about having a firm grip on a really good top-handle bag. At its core, it’s a look that means business. But unlike a bag that you throw over your shoulder or chest, there’s more intention to a top-handle bag—you have to be determined to really hold it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Louis Vuitton’s Go-14 makes that easy to want to do, with a classic design reminiscent of the quilted patterns of the maison’s historic trunks.

And it’s hard not to feel the need to impulse-buy luxe bucket bags crafted by the likes of Bottega Veneta, Alaïa, and Hermès.</p><h2 data-node-id=39 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Fall 2023 Trend: Bags As Slouchy As Your Favorite Pair of Jeans<br></h2><img alt="the row fall 2023" title="the row fall 2023" width=1600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/00012-the-row-fall-2023-ready-to-wear-credit-brand-64ecfb24633c9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">The Row</span></p><img alt="gabriela hearst rtw fall 2023" title="Gabriela Hearst - Fall 2023 - RTW - Runway" width=4295 height=6442 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1247140640-64f23c906c941.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Rodin Banica/WWD</span></p><img alt="new york, usa february 11 a model walks the runway during the proenza schouler ready to wear fallwinter 2023 2024 fashion show as part of the new york fashion week on february 11, 2023 in ny photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Proenza Schouler - Runway - Fall/Winter 2023-2024 New York Fashion Week" width=2732 height=4098 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1465234449-64f23c826f7f6.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Proenza Schouler</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The only thing better than the slouchy sensation of an oversize pair of jeans is an outfit that matches its energy exactly. Bags at the Row, Loewe, and Burberry looked like crumpled bags made of luxurious leather, scrunched with an ease that makes them a dream to carry under your arm. If most purses feel too structured for you, this silhouette is your solution to an effortless accessory that’s as cool as a vintage pair of worn-in Levi’s 501s.</p><h2 data-node-id=45 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Fall 2023 Trend: ’90s Simplicity</h2><img alt="milan, italy february 23 a model walks the runway during the prada ready to wear fallwinter 2023 2024 fashion show as part of the milan fashion week on february 23, 2023 in milan, italy photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Prada - Runway - Fall/Winter 2023-2024 Milan Fashion Week" width=2835 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1468928129-64f6b377622de.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Prada</span></p><img alt="milan, italy february 23 a model walks the runway at the prada fashion show during the milan fashion week womenswear fallwinter 20232024 on february 23, 2023 in milan, italy photo by daniele venturelliwireimage" title="Prada - Runway - Milan Fashion Week Womenswear Fall/Winter 2023/2024" width=4000 height=6000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1468844678-64ed0163cb8bf.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Prada</span></p><img alt="irina shayk on the runway at tory burch fall 2023 ready to wear fashion show on february 13, 2023 in new york, new york photo by rodin banicawwd via getty images" title="Tory Burch - Fall 2023 - RTW - Runway" width=5504 height=8256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1247132858-1-64ed01725cbe9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Tory Burch</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It feels hard to remember a time when the ’90s weren’t trending, but the general public’s obsession with the decade shows no signs of slowing down. And the real key to looking like Chloë Sevigny or Angelina Jolie in the ’00s isn't just a head of tousled hair or a torso covered in leather, but a bag that’s simple, subtle, and—most importantly—sexy.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prada’s reedition 1995 brushed-leather bag and re-edition, re-nylon bag achieves this perfectly. As does Ralph Lauren’s RL 888. They’re like sublimely packaged time capsules that quite literally put the ’90s in your grasp.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
