Johnson’s heart shattered when she heard that her humorous and loving husband was no more on this day. The pair shared three decades of togetherness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/17799959_1336325093118715_3041330500017020562_n.jpg><p>As said above, He had complications of esophageal cancer. This infectious disease is cancer arising from the food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach.</p><p>Late Dawson caught up in this cancer as he smoked almost four packs of cigarettes per day. Surprisingly, he left smoking for the sake of his daughter at 61. Sadly, it was already late.</p><p>Another key point is that cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for nearly <strong>10 million deaths in 2020</strong>. And <strong>Esophageal cancer</strong> is one of them. Esophageal cancer is the eighth-most common cancer globally, with <strong>572,000 new cases</strong> causing about <strong>509,000 deaths every year</strong>.</p><h2>Richard Dawson’s Marriage with Gretchen Johnson</h2><p>Gretchen Johnson is now a 65-year-old beautiful woman. She has that silky blonde hair and glorious bluish-grey eyes. Someone would even fall for her while she is in the sixties. How could Richard, not in her twenties?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/gRETCHEN2.jpeg><p>Yes! Gretchen Johnson was 25 years old gorgeous, and stunning when she started dating the humorous man Richard Dawson. The duo met in May 1981 while johnson was a contestant and Richard was a host on<strong> <i>Family Feud.</i></strong></p><p>Not to mention, a 25-year-old Johnson might have fell head over heels as Richard used to kiss all the female contestants. Because of this, He was also known as The Kissing Bandit or Kissy face.</p><p>Those kisses, along with his quick wit, sly quips, and ability to make folks feel at ease in front of the camera, helped make the show a warm and pleasant one. I bet the show misses this incredible man terribly.</p><h2>Gretchen Johnson is Richard Dawson’s second wife!</h2><p>After dating for a decade, the adorable pair tied the know in 1991. Gretchen and Richard gave birth to a daughter just before a year from their marriage in 1990. Her name is Shannon Nicole Dawson. Moreover,&nbsp; She is an actress and model<b>, </b>as perfect as her parents!</p><p>Coming to the point, Gretchen is a second wife of Richard as he was married to actress Diana Dors before marrying her. Diana Dors and Dawson met in the late 1950s.</p><p>Diana Dors was popularly known as the blonde bombshell. They were married on April 12, 1959, in New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/wucimx3wbrmomehzh7uq.jpg><p>The blonde bombshell and The Kissing Bandit had two sons, Mark and Gary. Mark was born on 4 February 1960 in London. Similarly, Gary was born on 27 June 1962 in Los Angeles. Their marriage ended in 1967, divorcing in Los Angeles.</p><p>Unfortunately, after 18 years of divorce, <b>Diana Dors&nbsp;</b>died on 4 May 1984 due to ovarian cancer.</p><p>For more content, follow <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>ALLSTARBIO</a>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHAta3Rm6CoZpOkunC%2ByJyfmqqUYrGiw9KopWaZnpl6qL7ErZqhnZ5it7C0zaymp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
