Since then, we’ve had a lot of time to talk about a lot of different things.</p><p>“It seemed like everyone in the world knew about our infamous encounter at the VMAs, but something that you may not know is that Kanye West’s album, College Dropout, was the very first album that my brother and I ever bought on iTunes when I was 12 years old.</p><p>“Many of you may not remember that Kanye wrote and recorded his first single with his jaw wired shut after a car accident, or how he spent years studying the craft and the art of fashion and even learned to sew before launching his very own line that has been wildly successful.</p><p>“I have been a fan of his since I can remember, because Kanye defined what it is to be a creative force in music, <a href=#>fashion</a>, and, well, life.”</p><p>Taking lines from Kanye’s lyrics, Taylor finished her speech with: “So I guess I have to say to all the other winners tonight, I’m really happy for you, and I’mma let you finish, but Kanye West had one of the greatest careers of ALL TIME.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2Z%2FcMDAsqOoql2oxKqy02aumqGkmrFuxcSaqaxllqS%2FbrzEq52em6Riv6a%2Fz6ilrJ1dqbxut8CnsJ5lmaPBpr7RrqetoZ6ceqmx0Wamp2Wjqa6osY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
