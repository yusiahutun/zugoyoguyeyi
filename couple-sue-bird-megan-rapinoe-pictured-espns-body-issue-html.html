Their endurance is something that is pretty insane,' Sue said, 'Just the fact that they can go out there and run, I forget what it is, 8 to 9 miles in an hour and a half.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Similarly, Megan praised Sue for her ability to shoot on the fly during a basketball game.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I've done, like, one shooting drill, and it's so hard. The constant go, go, go,' she said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While they are both equally competitive on the field and the court, the couple said they lead a relatively chill life when off the clock.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'It's the most uncompetitive relationship I've ever been in, by far,' Sue said.
