Although a contractual dispute kept the drummer from participating in the band's recent comeback, Osbourne said he doesn't believe Ward could rejoin the band even if he wanted to.</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>"I don't think [Bill] could have done the gig, to be honest," Osbourne recently told the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">New York Daily News</a>. "He's incredibly overweight. A drummer has to be in shape. He's already had two heart attacks. I don't want to be responsible for his life."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Osbourne had previously touched on Ward's problems during an interview with Mojo magazine. "He [is] so out of condition," Osbourne said. The singer recalled a rehearsal from when the Black Sabbath reunion was first proposed. "You know them yellow fucking stick-on memo notes? He had them all over his fucking drums … He couldn't remember what the fuck we were doing."</p><figure id=15621a83-83cb-4895-a894-dce43e1b0967 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1inf02i></span><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6>Bill Ward and Ozzy Osbourne of Black Sabbath in 2011.

Ward didn't agree: "I play all or nothing," <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">he explained to Guitar International</a>. "I'm the drummer in Black Sabbath so I want to do the entire show." He also denied he was out of shape: "I would never, ever show up for a commitment that I could not do physically."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Despite Osbourne's harsh comments, he insisted that "the door is always open" to Ward's return. "It's not the same [without him]."</p><p class=dcr-epamsi>Black Sabbath's <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">first No 1 album in 43 years, 13</a>, was released in June.
