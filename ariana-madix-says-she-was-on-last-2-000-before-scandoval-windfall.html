Ariana Madix wasn't in the best place financially when she and Tom Sandoval broke up.

That is not true," she explained of the deals and opportunities she acquired <a href=#><strong>post-Scandoval</strong></a>. "It's like, on March 1st, was I financially prepared to move? No. Literally the week before all of this happened, I remember emailing my agent and manager and being like, 'Guys, let's start really trying to do some s--t. Because I'm not in a good place financially.'"</p><p>Offering more details in a confessional, Madix said that when she first started making "decent" money from her long run on the show, she and Sandoval decided to buy their Valley Village home.</p><p>"Then I was playing catch up all the way up until Katie [Maloney] and I found a great location for a sandwich shop [Something About Her]," she explained. "Then a bunch of my money went toward that. Now I was at a point where in March I was literally on my last $2,000. I am not kidding."</p><p>It's been a little over a year since news broke that Sandoval had been cheating on longtime girlfriend Madix, with their friend and co-star, Leviss, creating a scandal that captivated the internet and much of the TV world.</p><p>The aftermath and her split from Sandoval is the reason, Madix, says, that she took on so many work opportunities.</p><p>"He created this situation and now I am f---ing scrambling to get my s--t together to be able to, in a financially responsible way, move on to the next step," she noted in the clip.</p><p>After addressing the drama in the season 10 reunion special, Leviss checked herself into a mental health treatment facility for 90 days and has since left the show. Sandoval, meanwhile, stayed in the spotlight by touring with his band, Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras, and had a short stint on Fox's <a href=#><strong>Special Forces: World's Toughest Test</strong></a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:a72e1b4d-dbc6-43c7-9a4a-358e53fe023b data-container-ref=toofab:article:7e3fee09-3bfb-4d9a-8809-c4de92e4144a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/3a/5by4/2024/03/06/3a7e88410bbf4050988e28364ec8ddc8_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Lala Kent Clarifies Comments About Ariana Madix Having Head Up 'Her Own A--'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>He even started his own podcast, titled Everybody Loves Tom before returning to Vanderpump Rules for season 11.</p><p>As for Madix, well, her opportunities have been pretty bountiful since the scandal, doing everything from BIC razor commercial and an appearance at Raising Cane's to making it to the finals on Dancing With the Stars and <a href=#><strong>starring as Roxy Hart</strong></a> on the latest Broadway production of Chicago.</p><p>She's hopeful Something About Her will be a success as well -- when it opens that is.
