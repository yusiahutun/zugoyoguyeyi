A Veterans Era artist is eligible after 40 years.&nbsp;The full, rotating third category includes: Non-Performer, Songwriter and Recording and/or Touring Musician.</p><p>Most debates around who the next Country Music Hall of Fame inductee should be center on Modern Era artists, as there are simply fewer people&nbsp;who can present an artist like Gene Watson's credentials with authority.
