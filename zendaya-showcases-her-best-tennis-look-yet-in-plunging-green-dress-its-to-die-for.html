At the bottom of the plunging neckline was a cute tennis ball tying it all together. We are obsessed!</p><p>After showing off her blonde locks as of late, the Spider-Man star decided to switch things up a bit, heading back to her brunette roots with a neat bun.</p><p>The floor-length dress was so elegantly long, but her white stilettos poked out as she walked around the venue. We were hoping for the <a href=#>tennis ball shoes</a>, but that may have been just a bit too much!</p><p>“The tennis ball! This is so cute!!!” exclaimed one fan on X, formerly known as <a href=#>Twitter</a>.</p><p>“This look is to die for,” wrote another. “Zendaya always understands the assignment.” Yes, she does!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-channeled-old-school-hollywood-in-her-premiere-look>The star channeled ‘old school Hollywood’ in her premiere look</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>she’s an icon, she’s a legend and she is the moment!</p><p>zendaya wearing custom vera wang at the ‘challengers’ premiere in los angeles today. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/HshPRZGmPh</a></p>— zendayacollective (@dayacollective) <a href=#>April 17, 2024</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><p>It must be exhausting serving so many looks, but someone’s got to do it, right? Before her stunning neon gown, Zendaya took to the LA premiere, and once again, understood the assignment.</p><p>The star stunned in a black Vera Wang corset gown&nbsp;with a dramatic pink skirt, and once again, absolutely slayed the look. No tennis theme here, but no one was complaining about that!</p><p>“She’s an icon, she’s a legend and she is the moment!” exclaimed one fan upon seeing the breathtaking look.</p><p>“That is so elegant and gorgeous.
