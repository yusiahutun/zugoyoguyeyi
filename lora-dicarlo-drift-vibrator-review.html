It’s getting hot in herrrreee…and while I’d like to take all the credit, it should really go to my new favorite sex toy. As something of a sex toy connoisseur, I have quite the arsenal of vibes and stimulators these days, so I didn’t think there was a vibrator on the market that could really “wow” me."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As something of a sex toy connoisseur, I have quite the arsenal of vibes and stimulators these days, so I didn’t think there was a vibrator on the market that could really “wow” me. I mean, what haven’t I tried?? That said, I stand corrected after trying the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lora DiCarlo Drift Vibrator</a>, which is putting my oldies-but-goodies to shame.</p><p>Vibrators are my toy of choice—and, I admit, I usually opt for whichever ones look largest. It’s more of a visual turn-on than anything else, but I had my doubts when I first saw how small the Drift was in person. I was expecting something huge! Still, I charged it up and prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt. (Oh, and not that this is particularly, sexy, but the magnetized charging area was a super nice touch. So sleek!)</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>I’m not sure if Shakespeare was into <a href=# id=auto-tag_sex-toys data-tag=sex-toys>sex toys</a>, but allow me to quote him in defense of <a href=# rel=nofollow>the Drift</a>: “Though she be but little, she is fierce.” Fierce, indeed! This baby has three vibration patterns and seven vibration levels, all of which are intense. Like, I’m starting to wonder if my other vibrators are broken?! Once you find a fave vibration pattern and intensity level, you can use the toy’s ergonomic shape to your advantage for both internal and external stimulation.</p><p>And of course, the very best part: it warms up. I mentioned that, right?</p><p class=p1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

No, it’s not the first-ever vibrator to heat up, but it’s one of the first that didn’t make me nervous as it did so. I’m not trying to get below-the-belt burns, people! With a high temp of 104 degrees, the Drift reached the perfect heat to turn me on and provide a totally new sensation—and when I’m not in the mood, I have the option to turn the warming feature off and still reap the benefits of those super-powerful vibrations.</p><p>All in all, the Drift is a 10/10 for me. I’ve even come to appreciate its smaller size! it’s actually the perfect vibrator for travel, something I plan to do quite a bit now that I’m vaxxed and waxxed. If you feel the same, there’s never been a better time to buy, as shoppers to the Ella Paradis site can even snag an additional 15 percent off the Drift and all other <a href=# rel=nofollow>Lora DiCarlo toys</a> right now using the code “HOT” at checkout.</p><p>You already know I’m partial to <a href=# rel=nofollow>the Drift</a>, but if you’re in the market for something different, read on for a peek at a few other Lora DiCarlo sex toys below, all of which you can <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>shop</a> now with that extra 15 percent off.
