He offered up suggestions that she thought were coming from a credible source, but as the meeting went on, things took a creepy turn.</p><p>"I went, 'Wait a minute. He knows what he's talking about,'" she said. "I said, 'Okay, so I'll do it, like, more quiet, more real.' Then he wanted me to show my legs, and I said, 'You know, Mr. Capp, I don't know. I don't think so,' and then I sat down and he wanted me to give him a kiss, and I went, 'I don't do this. I'm sorry.'"</p><p>Of course, Capp was not happy with her reaction. Hawn recalled him telling her to go home and marry a dentist, and saying she was "never going to make anything in your life."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:777013e8-327b-5106-acdd-221ffe0c4808 data-container-ref=toofab:article:57a8e349-540b-5d3f-af3e-a90dc1d0ec8e data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/1b/5by4/2017/05/01/1ba6cf2cfa805b3392dd4451f5ffec8c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Amy Schumer Sneaks in Dirty 'Today' Joke After Savannah Guthrie Warns 'Stay Classy' (Video)</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I was crying and I didn't have any money to go back to the World's Fair, where I was dancing, and so he threw me $20 for a taxicab," she added.
