Indeed, many texting websites let you send free SMS messages. Many don't even have a registration process.</p><p>Here are the best sites to send free text messages to cell phones.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h2 id=textem>1. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TextEm</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/text-em.png><p>TextEm lets you send free text messages, but you first need to create an account. Although some people may prefer to send a message anonymously, having an account brings some notable benefits.</p><p>For example, you can curate a list of frequently used contacts and—depending on the recipient's carrier—get replies back into your TextEm inbox. If the carrier does not support responses to TextEm, you can set up email replies instead.</p><p>More than 100 carriers from the US and Canada are supported. If you need to send a message to a number outside North America, it is not the service for you.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>TextEm does not support bulk messaging; you cannot send the same message to several numbers at the same time. Don't worry, some of the other services we'll discuss do have the feature.</p><h2 id=sendsmsnow>2. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SendSMSnow</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/send-sms-now.png><p>SendSMSnow is another free SMS service that requires you to create an account before you can send messages.</p><p>Once you do make an account, you can generate a phonebook of contacts, add profile pictures, and receive replies to your messages in your personal inbox.</p><p>SendSMSnow also supports group messaging, though it is not free. For every message you send, you will be charged one cent for every user in the group. For example, a single SMS sent to a 20-person group would cost $0.20.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>In theory, the service works with cell phone numbers worldwide. We have no way to verify the claims, but you can reasonably expect most North American and European carriers to be supported.</p><p>The number of characters in messages is capped at 130.</p><h2 id=opentextingonline>3. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenTextingOnline</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/open-texting-online.png><p>OpenTextingOnline is a texting website that lets you send free SMS messages online without creating an account.</p><p>It works with carriers in about 50 countries. Most of North America and the European Union is covered, but so too are some less-common locations like India, Nepal, Panama, and New Zealand. Just be aware that not all the carriers in all the countries are supported. For more exotic locations, you might find only one or two that work.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You can use OpenTextingOnline to attach pictures, videos, and audio content to your SMS. It's a feature that is quite rare among free SMS services.</p><p>Because you do not need to make an account, you cannot receive replies to your messages. The maximum number of characters per message is 140.</p><h2 id=txtdrop>4. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">txtDrop</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/txtdrop.png><p>txtDrop is a well-established name in the world of free SMS online. It's been operational since 2013, and according to its own statistics, has successfully delivered almost 25 million messages in that time.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>You don't need to create an account, but you can receive replies in your email inbox should you wish.</p><p>txtDrop is also unique in that it offers a macOS widget. If you install it, you will be able to send messages directly from your Mac desktop without needing to visit the official site. And if you run a website, there's even a widget you can use on your page.</p><p>The service only lets you send free messages to the US and Canada. Other locations are not supported.</p><h2 id=send-anonymous-sms>5. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Send Anonymous SMS</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/send-anonymous-sms.png><p>Another way to send free text messages online with no registration is to head to Send Anonymous SMS.</p><p>As the name suggests, the service requires no personal details in order for you to send a free text message. So, if you want to prank someone, fire off a quick message, or just use a service to anonymously contact people, this service might be the answer.</p><p>Unlike the other free SMS sites we've mentioned, you can theoretically spoof a phone number that'll show on the other person's screen when they receive the message. It is unclear how that would work, but it's worth a shot if you're trying to pull off a prank. Just make sure you stay on the right side of the law.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Send Anonymous SMS has a maximum of 145 characters and supports more than 80 different countries around the world.</p><h2 id=textemnow>6. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TextEmNow</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/textemnow.png><p>Another service we like is TextEmNow. The main reason that it's worth recommending is because of the site's higher character count. Unlike most free SMS sites—which have a limit of around 150 characters—TextEmNow lets you write messages that are up to 300 characters long.</p><p>The site's developers also claim they do not log any IP addresses. We can't say whether it's true, but&nbsp;all the other&nbsp;texting sites we have discussed explicitly say they do log IPs (for spam/abuse monitoring), so TextEmNow's approach is a refreshing change.</p><p>Technically, you can use TextEmNow to text any mobile number in the world, but as we've seen elsewhere, location-specific restrictions may apply.</p><h2 id=globfone>7. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Globfone</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/globfone.png><p>Globfone lets you send local, national, and international text messages for free directly from your computer.</p><p>Doing so is a simple five-step process; there is no requirement to create an account. Just add the person's name, select the country code, enter the number, type your message, and hit the send button.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Sadly, you cannot use Globfone to receive replies or to attach other forms of content like pictures and videos.</p><h2 id=textport>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Textport</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/textport.png><p>Textport lets you send and receive messages to/from any US-based mobile number. MMS messages are also supported on both an inbound and outbound basis.</p><p>You can choose to send the message from a number in Los Angeles, New York, Houston, Chicago, or Miami, depending on the region of your recipient. MMS and emojis are supported, and you can send up to three messages per session. You can also receive an unlimited number of replies.</p><h2 id=afreesms>9. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AFreeSMS</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/afreesms.png><p>AFreeSMS is an international SMS service that you can use for free. It claims to be one of the fastest free SMS services in the world, but as before, we have no way to verify those claims.</p><p>A complete list of global countries is offered in the drop-down list, but it is unclear whether the service&nbsp;has an agreement with network providers in all the locales.</p><p>Each message is limited to 160 characters.</p><h2 id=sendatext>10. <a href=#>SENDaTEXT</a></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sendatext.png><p>The final entry on our list is SENDaTEXT. It lets you send a free SMS from both your computer and your smartphone, making it quite unique in the world of free SMS services.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>It is also one of the few free SMS apps that lets you place phone calls for free via the same web interface. Replies are supported.</p><p>The biggest downside of the service is the character limit—you are restricted to 120.</p><p>Check out our article on the <a href=#>best apps to make free phone calls</a> if you would like more information. Some of the apps even have <a href=#>unlimited SMS capabilities</a> if you are connected to a Wi-Fi network.</p><h2 id=sending-free-text-messages-from-a-computer>Sending Free Text Messages From a Computer</h2><p>In summary, yes, you can text someone from your computer for free. But the service that's right for you depends on a few factors:</p><ul><li>Where is the recipient based?</li><li>Do you need to be able to receive replies?</li><li>Is anonymity a critical feature?</li><li>Do you want to use a privacy-conscious service?</li></ul><p>Make sure you consider your answers before you hit the send button.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fZn1uv8itnKxlpKR6tLHNnWSfqpWaerWx161kpp2jqK6osdJmq6hlk5q5rXnPoaannaNiwK6%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
