As the host of <a href=#>HGTV</a>‘s My Lottery Dream Home, it’s no surprise the beloved reality star once lived in this gorgeous abode of his own.</p><p>Before the handsome hunk found the house of his dreams, he was happier than ever residing in Orlando, Florida. “Right now, I’m in an apartment,” he told the <a href=#>Orlando Sentinel</a> in January 2020, noting at the time that he was on the market for his forever home.</p><p>“I’m so busy finding everyone their dream home, I’m neglecting my own,” he joked with the outlet at he time, pointing out his busy schedule as a HGTV star got in the way. “I’m always on the road. We’ll get here eventually.”</p><p>Though David was still searching for the perfect residence, he already knew the location where he wanted to live. “I have it narrowed down to one street in College Park,” he said of the affluent neighborhood located outside of downtown Orlando “where you can experience urban living with a small-town feel,” per <a href=#>Orlandomainstreets.com</a>.</p><p>The Color Splash alum wasn’t shopping for a turn-key home, though. “I want a crappy house so I can fix it up and build on to it and customize it for myself,” he dished.</p><p>While he waited for the day to come, David was living his best life in his apartment. On <a href=#>Instagram</a>, he often gave glimpses inside the space, which featured a spacious bedroom, stunning kitchen, living area, dining room and more. The luxurious condo also boasts a small outdoor area.</p><p>For the Design Star winner, it didn’t matter where he found his dream home as long as it was in Orlando. “I had a choice of where I wanted to live, and I chose Orlando because all my best friends are living here, and they’re retiring here, and they’re not going to be moving anywhere else. My parents retired in The Villages. So I wanted to be here.”</p><p>In 2021, he finally found his dream home! The five-bedroom, four-bathroom Tudor-style residence is everything he could have ever wanted and more. Still, he is grateful for all of the memories made in his last apartment.</p><p><span>“It’s my dream right now,” he gushed to <a href=#>HGTV</a>. “It’s such a special and unique place, and every time people come in, the vibe here is so cool and chill. It’s a great entertainer’s home, and I love to entertain and I love to have people over, and the backyard is fantastic … So, I’m just living for the moment.”</span></p><p><strong>To see photos inside David’s former apartment, scroll through the gallery below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn56qlWKxsLHSZp%2BgrKaoeqWt1aKbZpqipLq0wMCdZKWhppp6sbTOraasZZ%2Bbeqe4zqugnZldnbyusY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
