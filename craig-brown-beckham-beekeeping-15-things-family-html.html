1)  David Beckham is an avid beekeeper. Each of his thousands of bees has its own made-to-measure cashmere V-neck jersey, to be worn in winter, or draped casually around its shoulders in the warmer seasons. The queen bee sports a tiny little Rolex watch, which the others take turns to wind up for her.
2) As a designer, Victoria Beckham has a keen eye for fashion and leaves nothing to chance."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

'It's the little things,' she says. 'Like, never make trousers with three legs, because most of your clients will only have two. And if you're designing a sweater, never forget the hole for the head, or the client won't be able to see out.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>3)&nbsp;At the last count, David sported over 500 tattoos. 'I take inspiration from everywhere,' he explains. Alighting from a train at Paddington station last month, he nipped into the nearest parlour and had 'See It, Say It, Sorted' tattooed on his left ankle and 'Delays Due To Industrial Action' on his right.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>4)&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-3f1eddb0-62ee-11ee-a5f1-f3485f9078af>Brooklyn Beckham</a> fronts a successful cookery series on <a style=font-weight:700 href=# id=mol-3f84f280-62ee-11ee-a5f1-f3485f9078af>YouTube</a>, teaching viewers to cook simple British cuisine, like toast. He's happy to share his tips with the general public. 'A lot of people make the mistake of forgetting to push the knob on the toaster down, so their toast ends up uncooked, so it's a bit like bread,' he says. 'And don't forget you can use the toaster quite a few times before getting a new one.'&nbsp;</p><img id=i-25643b1881d50e6d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/04/20/76175209-0-image-a-2_1696447871603.jpg height=612 width=634 alt="David Beckham is an avid beekeeper and has tried to pass on the hobby to his three youngest children" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>David Beckham is an avid beekeeper and has tried to pass on the hobby to his three youngest children&nbsp;</p><img id=i-377cc913afdde2fa src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/05/07/76048561-12594783-David_Beckham_and_wife_Victoria_Beckham_have_four_children_pictu-a-40_1696486194770.jpg height=616 width=634 alt="David Beckham and wife Victoria Beckham have four children, pictured here from left to right, Brooklyn, Cruz, Harper and Romeo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>David Beckham and wife Victoria Beckham have four children, pictured here from left to right, Brooklyn, Cruz, Harper and Romeo</p><img id=i-bea80b7593e74d69 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/05/07/76176037-12594783-Beckham_who_captained_England_at_the_2002_and_2006_World_Cup_is_-a-37_1696486194769.jpg height=463 width=634 alt="Beckham, who captained England at the 2002 and 2006 World Cup, is the subject of a new Netflix documentary" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Beckham, who captained England at the 2002 and 2006 World Cup, is the subject of a new Netflix documentary&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>5)&nbsp;David recently bought a brand new £750,000 rollercoaster for his garden. At the press of a button, it cries, whoops, cheers and wails. 'It's an emotional rollercoaster,' he explains.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>6)&nbsp;Every Thursday, Victoria takes over the family lounge and belts out a medley of Spice Girls hits. Her husband and children take the opportunity to visit their local cinema, half a mile away, but they always remember to shut the windows before they leave. 'It's surprising the way sound travels,' says David.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>7)&nbsp;Over the years, David has acquired a lot of wisdom about the nature of time. 'At the end of the day,' he says. 'It's the end of the day, at the end of the day. That's what I always say, at the end of the day.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>8)&nbsp;He likes to check that it is the end of the day on his £50,000 Patek Philippe watch. 'They say you never actually own a Patek Philippe. You look after it for the next generation. But I actually own mine, so they've got that wrong.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>9)&nbsp;David was born in Leytonstone, East London, and grew up in nearby Chingford. 'Never forget your roots,' he says. 'And colour them the same as the rest of your hair because then they look more natural.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>10)&nbsp;Another rule he lives by is: 'Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but one day I may need glasses for reading.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>11)&nbsp;His all-time favourite word is 'massive'. 'Massive is really massive,' he says.&nbsp;</p><img id=i-568810568688b11f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/05/07/76175367-12594783-The_new_Netflix_documentary_on_the_Beckham_family_pulls_back_the-a-38_1696486194769.jpg height=358 width=634 alt="The new Netflix documentary on the Beckham family pulls back the veil on both serious topics and oddities, including that&nbsp;David bought a brand new £750,000 rollercoaster for his garden" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The new Netflix documentary on the Beckham family pulls back the veil on both serious topics and oddities, including that&nbsp;David bought a brand new £750,000 rollercoaster for his garden&nbsp;</p><img id=i-9e966b8c75efc7e7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/05/07/76175461-12594783-Victoria_Beckham_opened_up_about_highs_and_lows_for_Netflix_incl-a-39_1696486194769.jpg height=358 width=634 alt="Victoria Beckham opened up about highs and lows for Netflix, including that she was upset with David for leaving her with the children after he returned to Europe from LA Galaxy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Victoria Beckham opened up about highs and lows for Netflix, including that she was upset with David for leaving her with the children after he returned to Europe from LA Galaxy&nbsp;</p><img id=i-4b73ea47214b9101 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/10/05/07/76175651-12594783-Brooklyn_Beckham_seen_with_his_father_is_also_a_successful_photo-a-41_1696486194770.jpg height=358 width=634 alt="Brooklyn Beckham, seen with his father, is also a successful photographer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Brooklyn Beckham, seen with his father, is also a successful photographer&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>12)&nbsp;Brooklyn is also a successful photographer. 'It's all a question of pointing the camera and pushing the button, but you've got to do them in the right order and at the right time,' he advises. Among his most celebrated photographs are 'Interior, Camera Case'; 'Blurred Dog, Possibly Labrador'; 'Interior, Jacket Pocket'; and 'Shoulder And A Bit Of Neck'.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>13)&nbsp;Victoria always lets two of David's bees accompany her whenever she visits the top fashion shows. 'I let them sit in Anna Wintour's chair, in the front row of the catwalk, just to give her a bit of a surprise. Luckily, Anna has a lovely deadpan sense of humour.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>14) David favours matching socks. 'If I'm going to wear a sock that is, say, grey, then I'd always want the other sock to be grey, too, and not blue or green or whatever. Unless the first sock was blue or green, in which case I'd like the second sock not to be grey but to be blue or green or whatever, so as to match it.'&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>15) Close to tears in their new Netflix series, Victoria reveals she was once 'stunned, literally stunned' when she couldn't find her £17,500 miniature designer clutch bag for five minutes in 2021. 'My people looked everywhere for it. Then I realised I was holding it. It was that small I'd mistaken it for a ring. But by that time, I'd ordered another, so that was all right.'&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJyVl661sY6aqa2hk6Gybn2RbnBtb2hofISeoIJ%2BZnqChKSPeaGemqSgkaJ6o7HEpJyeqJmjtG59lGaroaGenMBussCmoKWxXp3Brrg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
