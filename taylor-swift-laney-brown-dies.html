The Team Laney Facebook page announced the news early Wednesday:
My heart breaks right now. Our little angel on earth earned her pink glittery angel wings in heaven. She took her last breath at home in her bed at 3:10 surrounded by all her family and friends."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Our little angel on earth earned her pink glittery angel wings in heaven. She took her last breath at home in her bed at 3:10 surrounded by all her family and friends. I miss her so much already.</p><p>The West Reading, Pa. girl was battling Leukemia and not expected to live long when Swift phoned her. The next day, more than 10,000 carolers came to the hospital where she was being treated and sang outside her window. While unable to watch, Laney&nbsp;<a href=#>posted a photo</a> indicating she heard them and approved.</p><p>On Thursday, Laney’s father sent another message to her 135,000 Facebook followers, thanking them for the support. “And thou we are down only one child, this house feels so empty,” <a href=#>he said</a> in an emotional post. “There used to be a little girl normally already sitting on our couch watching tv when I wake up early in the morning. My life will never be the same since that little angel touched it.”</p><p>Laney's condition deteriorated earlier this week, with doctors turning their focus to making sure she was comfortable as she took her final breaths. "I am in such disbelief that my baby is no long with me," a post from her mother begins. "I keep sitting here waiting for her to call out "mama" to me. I keep waiting for her to walk by me and smile."</p><p>The 8-year-old also had a brother and little sister who is named as her best friend. Delaney Ann Brown had just celebrated her eighth birthday. She’s described as “a fashionista who loved to dance and loved pink, board games, card games, the beach, alligators and animal prints” in an obituary at the Kuhn Stitzel Funeral Home <a href=#>website</a>. A public viewing will be held on Sunday (Dec. 29) at 2PM.</p><p>In lieu of flowers, the family is asking for contributions to the Four Diamonds Fund.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXaGur7HYZpmrp6ejeqW1xKxm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
