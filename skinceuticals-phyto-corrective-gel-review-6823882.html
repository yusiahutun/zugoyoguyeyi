But when Covid began, my acne returned with a vengeance. My skin is constantly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>congested and breaking out</a>; I feel like a pubescent child again instead of a woman in her late 20s. As a beauty editor, I have all the tools and knowledge at my disposal to deal with this properly and methodically, but a few weeks ago, I was so frustrated that I <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>over-exfoliated my face</a> into smithereens. For the days following, I experienced some of the worst sore and inflamed blemishes of my life.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>I had the type of zits that hurt regardless of what I was doing, but they were especially sore when I moved my face in any way. After cursing myself for knowing better, I looked for something that would calm down my skin, reduce some of the constant pain, and have any ingredients that would exacerbate the issue. This is how I came to find, use, and love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">SkinCeuticals’ Phyto Corrective Gel</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>SkinCeuticals</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now:</strong> $70; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">skinceuticals.com</a>&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This green concoction has a medicinal, herbal smell and its consistency is thinner and less gooey than a gel but somewhat more viscous than a traditional serum. Before bed, I washed my face and applied nothing but the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Phyto Corrective Gel</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the morning, my skin was noticeably less red, and the blemishes were smaller, less inflamed, and most importantly for me, less sore. It was the first relief I’d experienced in at least a week. My face no longer felt angry at me, and that in turn gave me some emotional peace.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The soothing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Phyto Corrective Gel Serum</a> has a ton of noteworthy ingredients, including eucalyptus leaf, cucumber, and hyaluronic acid. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>Eucalyptus has anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties</a> that heal wounds (like distressed skin and blemishes) faster. I also personally find that it makes my skin feel clean and refreshed, combatting its usual oily state. Cucumber, meanwhile, is great for soothing and calming skin. It also helps with hyperpigmentation, skin healing, skin barrier health, and moisture thanks to a combination of vitamins A and C. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Hyaluronic acid</a> keeps my skin moisturized, and therefore, it’s able to heal.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This isn’t an everyday product for me, but it is now an integral part of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>my skin cycling routine</a>, given how acne-prone I am. It’s been especially useful while I’m on&nbsp; my period — when my skin is a hormonal nightmare.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While $70 isn’t exactly cheap for a serum, it’s a pretty good deal from a brand that’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">hero product is $169</a>.
