Ruth Steinem had a mental illness and had suffered a few mental breakdowns before her daughter was born, according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/03/how-gloria-steinem-became-worlds-most-famous-feminist/#close data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="National Geographic" data-vars-ga-product-id=56c5d90a-1e96-4b2d-ad3e-4e2ee893b041 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/03/how-gloria-steinem-became-worlds-most-famous-feminist/#close data-product-url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/03/how-gloria-steinem-became-worlds-most-famous-feminist/#close data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=22ca0bc6-084b-4810-9502-14a780238e14 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">National Geographic</a>. After the family patriarch, Leo Steinem, left the family, Ruth struggled with her mental health and medical care. Seeing doctors dismiss her mother was one of the first concrete ways Steinem realized the anti-woman bias that infiltrated every aspect of society.

She became pregnant at the age of 22 and sought out an abortion in London in 1957, before it was legal in England. She became inspired to talk about her experience years later while attending an abortion speak-out as a reporter for New York magazine, but she opened up about the event in detail in 2015 during an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/2015/10/26/451862822/at-81-feminist-gloria-steinem-finds-herself-free-of-the-demands-of-gender data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NPR interview with Terry Gross" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">NPR interview with Terry Gross</a>.</p>“I had been doing all of the foolish things that we then did [to terminate a pregnancy], like riding horseback, throwing ourselves down stairs. ... I am the most cowardly person you can imagine, physically speaking, but I did [throw myself down stairs]. ... I was desperate. I really was desperate. I just knew that if I went home and married, which I would've had to do, it would be to the wrong person; it would be to a life that wasn't mine, that wasn't mine at all.”<p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Steinem also dedicated her book, My Life on the Road, to the doctor who performed her abortion, Dr. John Sharpe. Although it was published long after his death, the author’s dedication recalled what he told her: “You must promise me two things. First, you will not tell anyone my name. Second, you will do what you want to do with your life.”</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">9 | She supported same-sex marriage as early as 1970.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Decades before it would be legalized, Steinem spoke candidly of her support of same-sex marriage.

Since the population explosion dictates that childbearing be kept to a minimum, parents-and-children will be only one of many 'families': couples, age groups, working groups, mixed communes, blood-related clans, class groups, creative groups. Single women will have the right to stay single without ridicule, without the attitudes now betrayed by 'spinster' and 'bachelor.' Lesbians or homosexuals will no longer be denied legally binding marriages, complete with mutual-support agreements and inheritance rights."</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">10 | She was criticized for working on contract with the CIA.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25772264?seq=1" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="report from Redstockings" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">report from Redstockings</a>, a radical feminist group, found ties between the CIA and Steinem during a period in the late '50s and early '60s, when she headed the Independent Research Service, an organization that was receiving money from the governmental agency to send non-Communist Americans to the Soviet-sponsored Vienna Youth Festival. Steinem had previously spoken to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nytimes.com/1967/02/21/archives/cia-subsidized-festival-trips-hundreds-of-students-were-sent-to.html?searchResultPosition=3" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The New York Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The New York Times</a> in 1967 about her CIA affiliation, nearly 10 years before the Redstockings report.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Far from being shocked by this involvement, I was happy to find some liberals in government in those days who were far-sighted and cared enough to get Americans of all political views to the festival," Steinem said then.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also defended her position to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Glazer-t.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Washington Post" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Washington Post</a>, "In my experience the agency was completely different from its image: it was liberal, nonviolent and honorable."<br></p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">11 | She was the first woman to speak at the National Press Club.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While promoting Ms. Magazine, Steinem became the first woman to ever speak at an event held by the National Press Club, a professional organization for journalists that had then only recently admitted woman journalists. According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://feminist.org/blog/index.php/2014/01/24/founding-feminists-january-24-1972/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="reports at the time" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">reports at the time</a>, Steinem opened her speech with a criticism on media.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"The real nitty-gritty comes here, for both women and minority men," she said.
