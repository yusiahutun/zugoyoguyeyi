Eventually, the pair began dating with the blessing of her family and wed shortly after in a grand celebration. After their love story unraveled on screen, Michael was left devastated when Apollonia was killed by a car bomb that was initially intended for him.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Who-Played-Apollonia-in-The-Godfather-Actress-Today-.jpg><p><span>Soon after the fatal attack, orchestrated by bodyguard Fabrizio, Michael returned to the U.S. completely heartbroken over his wife’s death. Eventually, he married his second wife, Kay Adams, portrayed by </span><b>Diane Keaton</b><span>, and welcomed two children, Anthony and Mary Corleone.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Though her time in the franchise was short, Simonetta certainly made a lasting impression on the audience.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Where Is Simonetta Stefanelli Now?</b></h2><p><span>After her breakout appearance in </span><i><span>The Godfather</span></i><span> in 1972, the Italian actress made a few film appearances with her then-husband, </span><b>Michele Placido</b><span>. She was married to the director from 1989 to 1994. Together they welcomed three children, Michelangelo, Brenno and Violante.</span></p><p><span>Other acting appearances made by Simonetta included a recurring role in 1974’s </span><i><span>Moses the Lawgiver</span></i><span>, 1983’s</span><i><span> Art of Love</span></i><span> and 1992’s </span><i><span>Scoop</span></i><span> as well as a number of Italian films. Her most recent acting role came in 1992’s </span><i><span>Close Friends</span></i><span>, per IMDb. Since then, she’s largely stayed out of the spotlight while her daughter, Violante, decided to pursue a career as an actress and singer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In October 2022, Simonetta gave a rare glimpse of her life away from the acting business.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I’m writing my first novel and writing poems that I keep to myself,” she told the Italian newspaper</span> <a href=#><i><span>Corriere Della Sera</span></i></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>She also reflected on her role in </span><i><span>The Godfather</span></i><span> 50 years after her big break in the film.</span></p><p><span>“I was completely unaware. I didn’t know who Coppola and Al Pacino were, I only knew Marlon Brando, I was crazy about him,” she recalled of landing the part in a cast full of film legends. “When they offered me the part and told me he was the godfather, I thought it was a joke. Nor was he on set in Sicily. I didn’t notice anything, I went around for a week, it happened in a flash: I see Al Pacino, the groom, I get killed. I had no idea what else was in the film.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46wn6hloKGuurHDZpipp5yhvK%2B1wGagp2WknbJus86dnZqsmJq%2Fbq3Crameq6NiwbCwwLJm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
