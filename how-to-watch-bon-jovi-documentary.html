The docuseries also explores vocal cord injury, which he underwent surgery for in 2022. “What you saw on film was shot last March in that scene when I couldn’t sing well, or two years ago when I was on the road,” Bon Jovi said at a Q&A for the docuseries in April 2024 of how the injury threatened to end his career. “I’m well into the recovery. I’m more than capable of singing. It’s just that for me, the bar is two and a half hours a night, four nights a week, before I say we’re going to go and do any shows.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>He continued, “So I’m well back on the road to recovery — not a day of it’s easy. Every day is a struggle, but I’m more than capable of doing it again. I’m fucking Bon Jovi!”</p><p>Bon Jovi previously shared that underwent the surgery because his vocal cords were “atrophying.” He described one of them as “thick as a thumb” while the other was “thick as a pinky,” so he had to undergo surgery to make them equal and size again. “I pride myself on having been a true vocalist,” Bon Jovi said at a <a href=# id=auto-tag_hulu data-tag=hulu>Hulu</a> panel in February 2024. “I’ve sung with Pavarotti. I know how to sing. I’ve studied the craft for 40 years. I’m not a stylist who just barks and howls. I know how to sing.”</p><p>He continued, “So when God was taking away my ability, and I couldn’t understand why, I jokingly have said the only thing that’s ever been up my nose is my finger — you know, so there’s no reason for any of this.” So where can fans stream Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story?
