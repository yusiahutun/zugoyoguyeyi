Net sales reached US$450 million last year.</p>In the jewellery industry, Seattle-based Blue Nile carved a name for itself by foregoing the traditional bricks-and-mortar presence and relying entirely on the internet for its marketing, sales and customer service through <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">www.bluenile.com</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Beyond its size, global recognition and revolutionary disruptive model, Blue Nile's greatest achievement goes back to fulfilling everything that Vadon wanted to find in a luxury jewellery store: excellent service, transparency and reasonable prices. The company also takes pride in delivering a great experience for customers, who are able to take control of their shopping process with the help of in-depth educational materials and specialised tools provided by the site.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Finding the perfect ring does not have to be complicated. That is the founding tenet of Blue Nile," says chairman, CEO and president Harvey Kanter. "The key is educating yourself, then finding a reliable retailer and getting the piece you want at the right price - and Blue Nile is the only place you can find all of these elements."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Empowering the consumer with knowledge and choice</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Taking the mystery - and often overwhelming confusion - out of the quest for diamonds and jewellery is Blue Nile's mission. From loose diamonds to engagement rings, wedding bands and designer jewellery, every piece is selected for exceptional quality and value.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"What makes a piece worth US$4,000 and a similar one worth US$10,000?" Kanter asks. "Many traditional stores may not be able to give you a straight, honest answer, but Blue Nile will go to great lengths to put you through a transparent, educational process so you know exactly what you are paying for."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Complementing Blue Nile's thousands of ready-made pieces is its "Build Your Own" feature, which allows buyers to customise rings, pendants and earrings by selecting one of the more than 150,000 diamonds and choosing their favourite setting to complete a jewellery piece that is right for them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Using the site's educational tools, customers can learn how to distinguish one diamond from another by its four Cs - cut, colour, clarity and carat weight - and maximise the quality of diamond for their budget.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blue Nile diamonds are available in 10 shapes and range from colourless to near-colourless with clarities of FL-SI2 grade. Each diamond comes with a grading report from an independent diamond grading laboratory, either the Gemological Institute of America or the American Gem Society Laboratories.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Platinum is Blue Nile's most popular choice of metal for engagement and wedding rings, and the company uses only 95 per cent pure platinum in its jewellery. For those seeking traditional gold jewellery, the site offers 14ct and 18ct white, yellow and rose gold.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Combining durability and shine, Blue Nile's silver jewellery is crafted from 92.5 per cent sterling silver, and features intricate designs. For added variety, the site also offers a range of Akoya, Freshwater, Tahitian and South Sea cultured pearls across a variety of different price points.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blue Nile's transparency, education and low-overhead model translates to hundreds or thousands of dollars in savings for customers, but the company considers this advantage only one of the many reasons why it is increasingly becoming the brand of choice for smart jewellery buyers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company strictly abides by the Kimberley Process, which tracks diamonds from mine to market, and guarantees that each diamond is conflict-free. Blue Nile also offers a diamond price match guarantee, a lifetime diamond upgrade programme and a 30-day return policy, no questions asked.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In addition, the company ensures that it is in tune with the latest trends, and offers a specialised mobile application for iPhone users. Released in 2010, Blue Nile's app allows users to research, compare and purchase high-quality diamonds, connect to Blue Nile's jewellery consultants, and browse a catalogue of other customers' creations through its one-of-a-kind Dream Box feature.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such commitment to ingenuity, quality, value and respect for customers has made Blue Nile an important partner to equally renowned names such as acclaimed bridal designer Monique Lhuillier, who designed a collection of engagement rings, wedding rings and diamond jewellery items sold exclusively at Blue Nile.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other designers who have contributed to Blue Nile's designer collective are Boston-based Bree Richey, who brings a modern twist to classic designs; and third-generation jewellery artisan Robert Leser, who combines gemstones and diamonds into bold designs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blue Nile also partnered with Seattle-headquartered high-end fashion retailer Nordstrom for a limited "clicks-and-bricks" experiment. Select Nordstrom stores have begun displaying special Blue Nile showcases since November last year, allowing engagement rings to be "seen, felt and touched" by potential customers, who can then complete their purchase online.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We believe that commerce and revenue growth will come out of a holistic experience for the customer. Look at our website and you will not see us boasting that our prices are 20 to 40 per cent below traditional stores," Kanter says. "This is because cost savings are but the icing on the cake when it comes to the Blue Nile experience."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Bringing the Blue Nile experience to China and Asia</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Valued at an estimated US$80 billion, China's wedding market is quickly catching up to the US, which remains the biggest wedding market at more than US$161 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blue Nile is excited by the opportunity to bring its unequalled experience to the rest of the world. Shipping to more than 45 countries, Blue Nile is focused on the opportunity presented by the growing market in China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company is treading the waters carefully, however, taking into account the market's different culture and business landscape.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We are trying to balance how much investment we make to ensure we are growing sustainably - with the knowledge and belief that we have to be there when the customers are ready, not when we are ready," Kanter says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blue Nile was the seventh-most recognised luxury jewellery brand in China even before the company had any presence in the country. The company is rapidly gaining traction - thanks to its steady investment in infrastructure development and local partnerships.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company initially partnered with a Chinese business with store fronts in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, before launching a direct-to-consumer business earlier this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since the launch, Blue Nile has also stepped up its marketing efforts by participating in local wedding shows. One show attracted more than 60,000 people, some of whom waited for hours just to purchase engagement rings from Blue Nile.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Blue Nile has also partnered with leading Chinese luxury shopping website Xiu.com for third-party online distribution of its products on the mainland.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We are actively building our infrastructure to realise our long-term vision, which is to bring Blue Nile's unsurpassed quality and value to the China and Asia-Pacific markets," says Jon Sainsbury, Blue Nile's president of international.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLDBza2psmWimr2wvtOsZputo567pr%2FSaKuoqJmYwHDB0ppknKelo8GzxYyrnKmnoql8or7TopqlnV9mg3J8lHBoaJqcqrJuusilnGaen6q7pbHDZpydrZOWwaq7zQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
