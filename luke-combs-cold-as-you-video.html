Directed by TA Films, the new clip follows a man through an emotion-charged night after he escapes his ex-girlfriend and her new lover through a secret door behind a jukebox in a retro-style diner.
From there, the lead character (Nick McNeil) enters a lively country bar and meets a love interest, with his ex in close pursuit. Ultimately, he leaves the bar together with his new date, bringing the song’s narrative of a bitter breakup full circle to the start of a new romance."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The video contains multiple "Easter eggs," according to the singer:&nbsp;Most notably, some fans are claiming that a moment when McNeil's character hits the number 26 on the jukebox is a veiled reference to Combs' upcoming album release, suggesting it means the record will arrive on Nov. 26.</p><p>Whether or not the reigning ACM Male Artist of the Year will drop his long-awaited third LP on that date, the "Cold As You" music video is rich with references to Combs' personal and professional past. In addition to the above-mentioned moments, he filmed the clip at a diner his college town of Boone, N.C., and at Whiskey River, a bar and restaurant chain owned by Dale Earnhardt Jr.</p><p>"Cold As You," which Combs wrote alongside Randy Montana, Shane Minor and Jonathan Singleton, is currently in the Top 20 and rising at country radio. All 11 of the singles he's released throughout his career have gone to No. 1.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>11 Luke Combs Songs That Proved 'Em All Wrong:</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqku8ybqmabn6Gxbq3SZrCorV2rtqWxzmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
