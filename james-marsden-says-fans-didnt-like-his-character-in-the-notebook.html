James Marsden’s character from The Notebook didn’t help him win over fans — especially ones who were invested in Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams) living happily ever after.
“I thought he was a good guy,” Marsden, 46, said during a Good Morning America interview on Thursday, February 13, but viewers didn’t agree.

You never know when you’re filming,” he explained. “You hope that it’s gonna happen, but that one I don’t think anyone saw it coming. [It’s a] pretty special thing to be a part of.”</p><p>The Westworld star has, however, been <a href=#>dealing with hot-and-cold fans</a> of the <a href=#><strong>Nicholas Sparks</strong></a> film since the very beginning. In 2015, he told <a href=#>Vulture</a> that “it’s a very polarizing movie with regards to my character.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Some people have even come up to him to say they would’ve chosen him in the end — unlike Allie, who picked Noah because if he’s a bird, so is she!</p><p>“I hear people say that [they would’ve stayed with me]. Then I also have people coming up and going like, ‘Ugh!’ They’re just disgusted by me,” he told the publication in May 2015. “Like, ‘How dare you get involved with their love? You are the a–hole in that movie.’ I’m like, ‘How is he an a–hole?’ He was a great guy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ2awG65wKuqnZ2eYsCixdJmnZqmo2KxqrDNrWSloZuaeqm10maaoZmilrC1sdFmoKdlpJ2ybrrOrZybp5%2BgfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
