So special, in fact, that there are festivities all around the country celebrating its start. With changing leaves, Halloween, apple harvests, Día de los Muertos, and Thanksgiving drawing near, the season is full of things to honor and appreciate. And no matter which part of the US you live in, there are fun events, meaningful traditions, and autumnal sights to take in. We’ve collected some of the best fall festivals in different regions of the United States — you might not even have to travel very far.</p><p>* We’ve divided the festivals by region: The Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, and West (shown below).</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/shutterstock_2174351861-e1664980765795.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Northeast Region</h2><p><strong>Harvest on the Harbor in Portland, ME, Oct. 27-30</strong></p><p>If you’re a foodie, this is the fall festival for you. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to its website</a>, Portland, Maine is one of the best small towns for food and restaurants. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bon Appétit</a> crowned it “America’s Foodiest Small Town” in 2009, and <a href=#>Forbes</a> called Portland “One of the Country’s Best Food Cities” in 2021.<strong> </strong>At this event, you’ll enjoy local food and drinks, and be a taster for the annual Maine Lobster Chef of the Year Competition (and you know what they say about <a href=#>Maine lobster</a> — it’s the best). <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy tickets online</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Great Jack ‘O Lantern Blaze in Long Island, NY, through Nov. 6 / Hudson Valley, NY, through Nov. 20</strong><br>This one-of-a-kind event, which was named best in state by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Travel + Leisure</a>, has attracted more than 2 million visitors since its debut in 2005. The Great Jack O’Lantern Blaze is a family-friendly walk-through that boasts “thousands of hand-carved pumpkins in elaborate displays [that] light up the night,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to its website</a>. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ticket purchases</a> benefit the preservation of Old Bethpage Village Restoration and Historic Hudson Valley.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Southeast Region</h2><p><strong>Oktoberfest in Helen, GA, through Oct. 30</strong></p><p>Helen is a quirky little town in northern Georgia in which almost every building — including its fast food restaurants — is architecturally Bavarian-themed. This makes it the perfect setting for Oktoberfest: an event featuring German food, dancing, and music. According to ExploreGeorgia.org, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this event</a>&nbsp; “is the longest-running of its kind in the United States.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Admission is free</a> for active and retired military service members.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dollywood’s Harvest Festival in Pigeon Forge, TN, through Oct. 29</strong></p><p>If you love <a href=#>Dolly Parton</a> but have never visited her Americana-themed amusement park, you’re missing out. The park — named the number one theme park in the United States by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TripAdvisor</a> this year — is full of some of Dolly’s favorite things: live entertainment, top-tier southern-style food, and a warm, friendly atmosphere.<strong> </strong>Drink in the autumnal beauty of the Smoky Mountains while savoring seasonal food and thrill rides at Dollywood’s annual <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harvest Festival</a>. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy tickets online</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mountain State Apple Harvest Festival in Martinsburg, WV, Oct. 13-16</strong></p><p>If a classic small-town fall festival is what you’re after, look no further. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This event</a> celebrates “250 years of agricultural history” in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Enjoy activities like an apple pie auction, a car show, and the coronation of the Mountain State Apple Harvest Festival Queen, Queen Pomona. <a href=#>The website notes</a> that their festival’s ruler is named after the “uniquely Roman goddess of fruit trees and orchards … [she] watches over and protects fruit trees.” Hopefully she’ll ensure that the apples are ripe and crisp this year. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy tickets online</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Midwest Region</h2><p><strong>Anoka Halloween in Anoka, MN, through Nov. 5</strong></p><p>Anoka, MN is dubbed “The Halloween Capital of the World,” due to its history as “the first city in the United States to put on a Halloween celebration to divert its youngsters from Halloween pranks,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">its website</a>. Attendees keep the tradition alive with movie nights, vintage flea markets, costume contests, and parades.

Impressively, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fodor’s</a> named this event “one of America’s best pumpkin festivals.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Buy tickets online</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Día De Muertos in Santa Fe, NM, Oct. 28-29</strong></p><p>The Mexican holiday of Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) is a more solemn tradition: it’s a time for families to celebrate and honor the lives of their loved ones who have passed away. To do this, family members create <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ofrendas,</a> which are altars adorned with marigolds, food, photos, personal items, and other favorite things of the deceased. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">History.com</a> states that “according to tradition, the gates of heaven are opened at midnight on October 31 and the spirits of children can rejoin their families for 24 hours. The spirits of adults can do the same on November 2.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Santa Fe’s inaugural Día de los Muertos celebration</a> will feature Mexican music, food, and ofrendas, plus the event ends with a Glow-in-the Dark Candlelight Parade that you won’t want to miss. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donations are encouraged</a> for certain events.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>West Region</h2><p><strong>Cambria Scarecrow Festival in Cambria, CA, through Oct. 31</strong></p><p>If you’re looking for an unconventional fall trip, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cambria Scarecrow Festival</a> might just be the perfect find for you. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This event features</a> “hundreds of scarecrows golfing, singing, swashbuckling, pedaling, dancing, and flying,” created and posed by local businesses, students, and residents. Toward the end of the festival, attendees can participate in a “Salute to Scarecrows,” during which they enjoy wine, local food, and a costume contest. Viewing the scarecrows is free, but you can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">buy tickets to the Salute to Scarecrows online</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Snowbird Oktoberfest in Snowbird, UT, through Oct. 16</strong></p><p>Utah’s beautiful Snowbird Ski Resort is home to a family-friendly Oktoberfest celebration — one of the largest festivals in the state — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and this year marks its 50th anniversary</a>. Enjoy live music, locally-brewed beers, German food, and activities in the scenic Rocky Mountains.
