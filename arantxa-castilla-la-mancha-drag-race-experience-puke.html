And where the fish is RuPaul."</p><p id=eTHNfpal7xy data-wc=36>Arantxa's exit following the 'Happy Ending Ball' was doubly emotional for the star as she was in the bottom two against her close friend, Choriza May, with the pair's fairytale-inspired looks failing to impress the judges.</p><p id=ebwCYW6_Y2M data-wc=86>Despite tears flowing from both queens, they shared an incredibly sweet moment while La Grande Dame and Keta Minaj lip-synched for the win, with the duo dancing energetically alongside one another in the back. Lifting the lid on the moment, Arantxa shared: "In the moment that I realised that it was Choriza and me in the bottom, it was like, 'Okay, I'm gonna go to bed feeling like [expletive], because either I stay or I go' and no matter what I'm not gonna see her again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f7419a8f17f4-arantxa-castilla-la-mancha-runway.jpg><p id=eSYZFGxowOj data-wc=69>She added: "Right before the lip sync started, Choriza and I looked at each other and <strong>we were like, 'You know what, this is going to be the last time that we're going to be together here, so let's take this three-minute song and celebrate our friendship'</strong>.

However, Arantxa added that she believed it was "50/50" as to who the French queen would send home.</p><p id=eL9Ih4H26AJ data-wc=63>Due to Arantxa's early exit, the performer was robbed of her planned "double ru-demption" when it comes to the show's iconic Snatch Game challenge, which sent her home on her original series. Although she wouldn't give too much away, Arantxa teased: "I did awful on my original Snatch Game, according to the judges, and I did awful on the runway, according to me.</p><p id=eOwHVrAAejK data-wc=60>"The Snatch Game that I was doing was a character that we paid homage to her on the runway of Drag Race Espana.
