Can Indonesia’s Komodo dragons survive Chinese tourists?
“We still don’t have a common understanding on the meaning of ‘premium destination’. It is being worked out by the tourism ministry in Jakarta,” said Agustinus Rinus, a local tourism official."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I have warned agencies to be careful.

The transport ministry said it would spend 1.2 trillion rupiah (US$86 million) to expand the airport’s runway, apron and international terminal, and another 5.7 trillion rupiah to fund its operations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hotasi Nababan, the project leader of the airport expansion plan, said works would likely start in September this year, or the beginning of 2021 at the latest. “We have big plans and we want to make Labuan Bajo the entry point to destinations in Flores Island,” he said.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Indonesia foils illegal sale of Komodo dragons on Facebook</span></p></a></h3>The plans have faced unexpected spanners in the works.

Officials say they have yet to assess the impact the virus will have on tourism.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, observers have warned of the risks a tourism blitz might bring to the region, citing Bali as an example to avoid. The province, an hour’s flight from Labuan Bajo, has been suffering the effects of overtourism, including vandalism to historic architecture, plastic-waste pollution and dilution of local culture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/02/12/1a2cd6a0-4732-11ea-befc-ef9687daaa85_1320x770_104303.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Having a travel site shut down due to overtourism would be a disaster for smaller regions such as Labuan Bajo, which was dealt a blow last year when the central government announced plans to close Komodo Island – one of the larger islands within Komodo National Park – for one year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some of the environment ministry’s concerns included poaching, food handouts by tourists altering the lizards’ eating behaviour and large crowds affecting the animals’ mating habits. But officials later shelved the decision after strong protests from locals.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Other analysts have also noted that extensive marketing and training would be needed if the region were to host more visitors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“While tourism could be one of our hopes to boost foreign exchange revenues, there is much to be done in terms of promotion, tourism infrastructure and human resource skills,” said David Sumual, an economist at PT Bank Central Asia in Jakarta.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Indonesia has 0 coronavirus cases so far, and it’s making people fearful</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Amid the raft of work needed to transform Labuan Bajo, at least one hotelier is optimistic.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Antonelo Benedetti, the owner of Komodo Resort on the nearby Sebayur Island, said his clientele consisted mostly of high-end European travellers who would fork out top dollar to visit the region.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He is also trying to woo wealthy Chinese travellers by marketing his resort at tourism exhibitions in Guangzhou and Shanghai.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Benedetti said one popular local suggestion to make the area feel more exclusive was to raise the entry fee for foreign visitors to Komodo National Park from US$7 to US$1,000 – an idea he supported.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is not a problem as far as I can tell, as long as the service is excellent,” he said. <span class="tw_sectioncolor css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1><span class="courier css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>■</span></span></p><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316"><u data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94314">Purchase the China AI Report 2020</u></strong></span></a><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316"> brought to you by SCMP Research and enjoy a 20% discount (original price US$400).
