In early 2023, he started appearing on the TikTok star’s videos, and clearly, these two were tight! Later, Alix even created a segment dubbed “Tea Time with Topher” with him, and it wasn’t long before Alix’s fans hit the follow button on Topher’s page.</span></p><p><span>Thanks to their friendship, Alix also invited Topher to be her “plus one” for the 2023 Tarte influencer trip to Turks and Caicos.

What exactly happened is unknown but the friends went in as besties and left (after days of endless alcohol and partying) seeming very distant.</span></p><p><span>The two then stopped making videos together and on top of that, Topher shared a TikTok with two other popular creators on the trip, @stassibaby and @victoriavillarroell, which seemingly threw shade at Alix as they mocked “pick me girls.”</span></p><p><span>Plus, when Alix returned home, she cried on TikTok live but didn’t share any details as to what happened.</span></p><p><span>Obviously, as fans caught the wind of this, they turned their backs on Topher.
