Even in death at 35, she is as unstoppable as ever. Nicky’s last message for her followers is powerful and realistic leaving fans with hope to see more of her projects in the future.</p><p>She wrote: “I didn’t lose anything, the cancer eventually took over & that’s okay, we all knew this would happen,” adding, “I don’t think we are ever prepared to hear the words, we think we are indestructible & a magic cure will appear, but the truth is we all live this life day to day (we just knew our days are shorter).”</p><p>“So please promise me to cherish those around you and give your friends and loved ones the biggest squeezes! GO GRAB LIFE! You never truly know what is coming around the corner – so don’t take anything for granted.”</p><p>Even in the last days of Nicky’s life, she envisioned a future for her plans trying to create projects that could help someone out there as she wrote: “I’m a believer in energies and if people hold on to the positive energy we have created from this and other pages like it, then I will always be with you. Mr.G has some words to follow as we both wanted to do this part together x. Love you all my bootiful hoomans!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicky-never-accepted-half-measures>“Nicky never accepted half measures”</h2><p>Nicky’s cancer journey began in 2018 when she went through a series of heartbreaking news including learning about her metastatic breast cancer which has spread and can not be cured and going through a miscarriage. What could only be called the worst point of someone’s life became a turning point for Nicki as she chose to brave through her days documenting her treatment journey, encouraging more people to take life positively, and supporting charity projects for cancer patients.</p><p>Speaking of the UK <a href=#>celebrity</a>‘s spirit, her husband gushed: “Nicky never accepted half measures, she took life with both hands and made each moment special and memorable. She has created a legacy here, a place where anyone can see that life is for positivity and smiles and happiness. Even through hardship…even if it seems impossible.”</p><p>Nicky’s work towards the cancer community will continue to shine light in the lives of many as her husband Mr. G revealed: “Nicky has still got some incredible things to share on here and I am hoping you will stick around to see them come to fruition. I will share it with you in her place, just as she would have wanted. I just ask you bare (to bear) with me a little.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmlxX2d9cLXNn6OunZ6YsrN51qugrZ2jYrOqusClZKado6iuqLGMmqWnp6WjsKq6xmafnqpdpMSvedOrmKChk2Kxpq3ToWSarF2WtKZ5km5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
