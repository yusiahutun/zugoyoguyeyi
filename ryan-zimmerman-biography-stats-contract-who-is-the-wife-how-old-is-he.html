Another sport in which he blossomed was basketball, although he did not take it seriously.</p><p>When his mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1995, life took a hard turn for the family.

After a stint with the Savannah Sand Gnats, the Nationals’ minor league A side, and then with the Harrisburg Senators, Zimmerman was called up to the Major League when the roster was expanded in September 2005.
