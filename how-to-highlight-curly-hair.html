She adds that curly hair reflects light differently than it does on straight hair, which can make some colors appear slightly different than they actually are.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-should-i-consider-before-highlighting-my-curly-hair></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Should I Consider Before Highlighting My Curly Hair?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Essentially, you need to consider how much effort you're willing to put into maintenance.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Will you condition and mask your hair regularly? Will you gently detangle your hair? Are you the 'wear a bun for a week at a time without combing your hair out and re-moisturizing' type of person?," asks Jaxcee, a New York-based colorist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Coily Collective</a>. "If you're not prepared to maintain your hair at home, I don't see highlights in your future."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Turns Out, Using a Gua Sha on Your Scalp Can Promote Healthy Hair Growth</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-should-i-ask-my-colorist-before-getting-highlights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Should I Ask My Colorist Before Getting Highlights?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before anything else, make sure your stylist is well-versed in coloring curly hair. Once you've picked your colorist, McCutcheon says you should ask them if your hair can handle the color process to avoid damage. "You should also ask what upkeep will be like and what maintenance will be like," she says. "Coloring your hair is a commitment — you need to know what you're getting yourself into and if you're realistically ready for it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, she suggests bringing an inspiration picture for your stylist's reference. "Choose a picture of someone whose hair looks closest to your own to ensure a more realistic expectation," she adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-often-should-i-wait-in-between-highlight-appointments></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Often Should I Wait In-Between Highlight Appointments?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Curly hair tends to be more forgiving when it comes to the grow-out process," says McCutcheon. Because of this, she says you can stretch out your salon appointments longer than people with straight tresses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, it's all about your personal preference. "It depends on how rooty you're okay with," she says. "If you enjoy a more polished look, get your highlights retouched every two to three months. If you love a more grown-out look, wait four to six months in between appointments."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-maintain-my-curly-highlights></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Maintain My Curly Highlights?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Jaxcee recommends using bond-building treatments such as Olaplex No. 3 ($28, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a>) and K18 Leave-In Mask ($75, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>sephora.com</a>) to keep your hair strong and healthy.
