'I don’t feel so paralyzingly embarrassed that I can’t enjoy myself and find joy in him enjoying himself.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>She also jokingly added: 'My stomach roll may be in the way sometimes, but it's never in the way of a good time.'&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>What's more, she went on, she is more than just her weight - and so is her husband.
