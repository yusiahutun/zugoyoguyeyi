When first sold, did it leave Apple as a brand new device or one that had been previously refurbished? Luckily, there's an easy way to tell. Here's how.</p><h2 id=find-your-iphone-39-s-model-number>Find Your iPhone's Model Number</h2><p>Open the Settings app and navigate to General > About.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/about.png><p>Once you tap on About, you'll be presented with a list of important information about the iPhone, including the device's name, its software version, and a model number.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/model_number.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pay careful attention to the model number, because this will reveal the origin of the iPhone.</p><ul><li>If the model number starts with <strong>M</strong>, it was purchased new from Apple.</li><li>If the model number starts with <strong>F</strong>, it was refurbished by Apple or a carrier.</li><li>If the model number starts with <strong>P</strong>, it was sold as a personalized iPhone with an engraving.</li><li>If the model number starts with <strong>N</strong>, Apple provided it as a replacement device for a malfunctioning iPhone.</li></ul><p>If you find that your phone was refurbished, it is not necessarily cause for alarm. Apple puts its <a href=#>Certified Refurbished products</a> through a rigorous process that makes them like-new. They clean each unit thoroughly, replace any broken parts if necessary, and change the battery and the outer shell.</p><p>In general, Apple Certified Refurbished products look and operate like brand new iPhones, but for legal reasons, Apple cannot sell them as new. Apple typically offers these refurbished products <a href=#>at a sizable discount</a>, so they can be a great deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carriers such as AT&T and Verizon also refurbish iPhones and sell them at a discount. Unlike Apple, they may not change out the battery or provide a new 1-year warranty on the phone. (You can check the warranty status on your iPhone by visiting <a href=#>Apple's warranty site</a> and entering the device's serial number.)</p><h2 id=third-party-refurbished-devices>Third-Party Refurbished Devices</h2><p>If your phone was previously refurbished by an independent repair operation that isn't authorized by Apple, the model number would not necessarily reflect that. Few third-party vendors have the stringent standards for refurbishment as Apple does, so it is best to avoid third-party refurbished devices if possible.</p><p>While knowing the Apple-based origins of your iPhone won't make much difference in how it functions — that depends more on how previous owners treated it — it's always good to be more informed, and this quick tip does the job.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGhtbm5oa4BwtM6wZK2nXZi1pq%2FKZqCfZamkwrN5yKmfqKaVYsSiv4yrnJ%2Btope2tLTEnWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
