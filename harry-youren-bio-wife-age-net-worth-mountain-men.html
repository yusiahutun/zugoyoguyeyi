Well, Harry Youren can and has left all the hustle and bustle of city life to live in the wilderness. And it’s all featured on History Channel’s </span><i><span>Mountain Men</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>This Harry Youren Bio explores his life.</span></p><h3><b>Harry Youren On Mountain Men</b></h3><p><span>Harry Youren is the “last in a long line of frontiersmen stretching back to the pioneer days” who lived beneath the glacier-carved peaks of the Sawtooth Range with his bother Kid. Together, the brothers joined </span><i><span>Mountain Men</span></i><span> in 2019 for its 8th installment, and fast forward to 2022, they were still preparing themselves for the harsh winter.</span></p><p><span>From clearing trails to running cattle to navigating whitewater to hauling supplies or hunting down meat to fuel, Harry and his brother are the jack of all trades. In any season, they were found far from civilization and committed to spending their lives in the mountains by any means necessary.</span></p><p><span>But they weren’t the only ones with such passion. Also featured on the History Channel’s survival show were their co-stars — Eustace Conway (ever since season 1), Marty Meierotto (ever since season 1), <a href=#>Tom Oar</a> (since season 1), Jake Herak (since season 7), Mike Horstman (since season 7), Josh Kirk (since season 9), and <a href=#>Martha Tansy</a> (since season 10).</span></p><p><span>The show’s official synopsis for season 11 (2022) read, “Montana’s Tom and Nancy Oar prepare for the long winter ahead. Jake Herak battles dense fog and mountain terrain on foot in pursuit of elk. In Wyoming, Josh Kirk attempts to move a 150-year-old log cabin to the heart of his bison ranch, but the hazardous journey threatens to topple the historic structure. And in Alaska, Martha and Elli Tansy each harvest a caribou, sending them on an all-night off-road mission to extract their kills.”</span></p><p><span>It’s a surprise why didn’t they include the Youren brothers in their description.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Harry Youren Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Harry Youren garnered a net worth of under $700 thousand by 2022.</span></p><p><span>A houndsman, cowboy, and a big game guide by profession, Harry has been hunting ever since the age of 1. Yes! With his father Dusty, the </span><i><span>Mountain Men</span></i><span> star has been exploring the different lands learning to adapt to different areas and terrain, which eventually helped him understand different types of games.</span></p><p><span>As for his hunting style, it has a touch of the old school. He grew up hunting while using triangulation devices to find dogs. However, he now uses Garmin GPS collars and trackers. But that doesn’t detract from his will to hunt traditionally.</span></p><p><span>In case you’re interested in hunting with him, find Harry at </span><i><span>Youren Outfitters</span></i><span> (located outside of Boise, Idaho) where you can book cougar and spring bear hunts. However, this wouldn’t be a five-star experience with fancy lodges, five-star cuisine, or recreational activities at a ranch. Rather, </span><i><span>Youren Outfitters</span></i><span> is all about hunting and filling your tag.</span></p><p><span>“We enjoy modern comforts at camp or the lodge, depending on the season, but hunters come here to kill,” they explained. Their hunt takes place in a very scenic, rugged area of the Boise Mountains, but only about three hours away from Boise and the airport.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Also,&nbsp; while the hunting area is accessible, it is certainly remote and there is no cell service.</span></p><p><span>Talking about Harry’s education, he attended </span><i><span>Fernie Secondary School</span></i><span> and the </span><i><span>School of Hard Knocks</span></i><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Harry Youren Age</b></h3><p><span>Harry Youren was 33 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Mountain Men</span></i><span> season 11.</span></p><p><span>He is three years younger than his brother Kid.</span></p><h3><b>Harry Youren Wife: Is He Married?</b></h3><p><span>No, Harry Youren isn’t married as of 2022. Or at least, this was what his FB status mentioned.</span></p><p><span>But then again, given his will to live in remote places with no access to running water or electricity, it certainly might have been difficult for the star to find a wife.</span></p><h3><b>Is Harry Youren On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>Yes, find him on Instagram @</span><a href=#><span>yourenoutfitters</span></a><span>, FB @</span><a href=#><span>yourenoutfitters</span></a><span>, and Youtube @</span><a href=#><span>Youren Outfitters</span></a><span>. But these are his professional accounts.</span></p><p><span>His private account only existed on FB @</span><a href=#><span>harryyourenTV</span></a><span> and @</span><a href=#><span>harry.youren</span></a><span>.</span></p><h3><b>Harry Youren Height</b></h3><p><span>Harry Youren stands tall at a height above 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm).</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li><h4><b>Where Does Harry Youren Live?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>Harry resided in Sweet, Idaho as of 2022.</span></p><p><span>Before that, he resided in North Powder, Oregon; Lovelock, Nevada; Hailey, Idaho; Pleasant Valley; Delta, Utah; Carey, Idaho; and Garden Valley Idaho.</span></p><ul><li><h4><b>When Is Harry Youren Birthday?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span>We don’t know when Harry celebrates his birthday.

In one of his ventures, he even was fined and placed on probation for guiding paying clients on a mountain lion hunt in Nevada without proper permits.</span></p><p><span>It was Harry’s father, who started </span><i><span>Youren Outfitters</span></i><span> in the 1970s and went on to retire in 2007.</span></p><p><span>As for Harry’s siblings, his brother Kidd starred alongside him on </span><i><span>Mountain Men</span></i><span>, while his other brother Matt Youren chose to remain out of the spotlight.</span></p><p><span>Also, Harry has a grandmother named Janet Youren who turned 78 in October 2021.</span></p><p><span>Sadly, his grandfather James Edward Youren passed away on April 6, 2014, at the age of 81.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmoZmip8Zuxc6uqZ6mXZe2sHnWop2eZZGcsm66xK1ksKeiqbVuuc6upa2ZmaN6rrHNaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
