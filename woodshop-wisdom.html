And there's all you always need to grab one more. So go ahead and grab the extra clamp before you start."</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-06-15_at_4.18.34_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shop Clamps ﻿Woodshop Sign&nbsp;</a></p><h3>&nbsp;<strong>A Craftsman Never Blames His Tools</strong></h3><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>This old proverb is said of someone who could have performed a job better but lays blame on his tools rather than taking responsibility for their failure. Don't get us wrong, we believe in good quality tools, but we also think hard work gets you far.

On the day of filming, it wouldn't fit through the door because we didn't measure the door. So we've learned that you should measure twice. It makes life a lot less frustrating."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-06-16_at_3.24.13_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Measure Once, Cuss Twice&nbsp;</a></p><h3><strong></strong></h3><h3><strong>Don't Spit on the Floor</strong></h3><p>Around the turn of the 20th century, in rural Mississippi and even New York, restaurants and other establishments used signs that would tell people, "Don't spit on the floor." Instead, you would spit into the spittoon.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/IMG_3690_13345007-63d0-4715-9e60-87616646e3a9.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span>Josh says, "Our Scotsman General Store was an old feed store built in the early 1920s. That building was torn down, and this one was rebuilt in the 1960s. There were signs and markings all over the building, and that was one of the common phrases seen in public spaces from that time, say the 1920s and even 1880s."</span></p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-06-16_at_3.44.07_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Don't Spit Sign</a></p><h3>A Bad Day Woodworking Is Still A Good Day</h3><p>A self-explanatory phrase, but even the worst days in the shop are better than anywhere else. For a skilled woodworker, there's always a lesson learned, and no creative endeavor is wasted.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-06-16_at_3.52.06_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shop Good Day Sign</a></p><h3>Get An Early Start Tomorrow by Cleaning Your Work Station Today</h3><p>Josh says, "We've always loved the iconic Mather Work Incentive Posters from the early 20th century.

Since the best result is found "in the details," what do you do with mistakes? Some of the best woodwork have unintentional marks in the wood or aesthetic features that add to the piece and never take away. This is your sign to own your mistakes!&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-06-16_at_3.58.57_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3></h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It's Not A Mistake Sign</a></p><h3></h3><h3>A Dusty Shop is A Loved Shop</h3><p>An expression that makes us feel better about not cleaning the sawdust off the floor, but a true one nonetheless. You'll rarely find a good woodworker in a perfectly clean woodshop. This is your sign to keep the cuts clean and the floors dirty.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1800/9573/files/Screen_Shot_2022-06-16_at_4.19.42_PM.png alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dusty Shop Sign</a></p><p>There's no doubt that there will be some hardship and frustration in the wood shop, but with the right tools, a good design plan, and a little wisdom, there's nothing too challenging to build.&nbsp;</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Browse Scotsman Woodshop Collection&nbsp;</span></a></h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7ra3Uq5ylpZWnsKK606KjnmaTpLpwrsuonqxnmqTCs7rApWawp5%2BZwKm7z2auoquUpLo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
