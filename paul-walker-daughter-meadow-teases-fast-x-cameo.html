In the caption of her post, she recalled how she would visit her late father on set, and described her cameo as an opportunity to "honor my father's legacy."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"The first fast was released when I was one year old!" she wrote. "I grew up on set watching my father, Vin, Jordana, Michelle, Chris and more on the monitors. Thanks to my dad, I was born into the fast family. I can't believe now I get to be up there too. With those who have been around to see me grow up."</p><p>Meadow continued, thanking the film's director, Louis Leterrier for his "kindness, patience and support."</p><p>"It feels like you've been part of the family since we started, I'm happy it's just the beginning. I am so blessed to be able to honor my father's legacy and share this with him forever x," she said. "I love you all so much."</p><p>Paul passed away at the age of 40 following a car accident in November 2013. "Furious 7" was in production at the time.</p><p>Back in February, <a href=#>Vin Diesel</a> -- Meadow's godfather -- confirmed her cameo in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Extra</a>.</p><p>"There is a very wonderful, rich feeling when you can make someone's wish come true," he said. "If you are lucky enough in life to be able to do that, what's better than that?"</p><p>The "Fast and Furious" franchise has continued to honor Walker's memory by allowing his character to live on every film since his death.</p><p>"When the tragedy happened back in 2013, we stopped filming 'Furious 7' for about five months because we were wrapping our heads around what we were going to do, while mourning," the 55-year-old said during a 2021 appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E!'s Daily Pop</a>. "And the studio accepted a bold decision, which was to allow the character to exist in our mythology."</p><p>"And to that end alone, you have to honor that. On a personal level, we started this franchise together," he added at the time. "Alongside us starting the franchise, we started a brotherhood. Our brotherhood will outlast the franchise."</p><a id=gallery-link-f87e049b-ab86-49ef-8182-123f1b10ad26 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:f87e049b-ab86-49ef-8182-123f1b10ad26 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:6689671e-9869-4463-be88-8463db28a20f data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/7c/4by3/2023/05/08/7cb5b980ddf24456a84b1c082ce3711d_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25mamlfpa62uIywmKWjlad6pa3UoJ%2BtnaJiuqatw6iuZqyVlsCmv4yfmKysXa16pK3MnqZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
