(She became the first main cast member from any <a href=# rel=noopener>Law & Order</a> show to win an Emmy.)</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Parade</a> in 2019, Hargitay opened up about why she thinks<a href=# rel=noopener> Law & Order: SVU</a> has been on the air for so long. “SVU resonates because it’s a path to healing and a path to survivorship,” she said at the time. “Each week, Olivia Benson and the team depict an environment of compassion, sympathy and justice, providing hope to those who experience shame and isolation caused by sexual violence. The conversations that the show inspires have brought a greater awareness and understanding of the issues. And every disclosure is a chance to show that a victim is to be believed.”</p><p>However, with so many seasons on the same show, there are bound to be details that Hargitay has forgotten about. In an interview on Late Night With Seth Meyers in 2019, Hargitay revealed that she forgot the storylines of one of her episodes while watching a rerun on <a href=# id=auto-tag_tv data-tag=tv>TV</a>. “However, about a month ago, I did and I stopped. And it was so old, and I’m like, ‘I don’t remember that,'” she said at the time. “And I said, ‘Oh, I’ll just watch and remember what episode it was.’ And I sat there, watching and watching. Half-hour went by, got completely engrossed in the show. Didn’t remember a thing. Didn’t even know it was me! Like, ‘This is a good show!’ But it was so sad, because I could not remember. And then I tried to remember, and I just couldn’t.”</p><p>Of course, what we’re sure Hargitay won’t forget is how much she makes on SVU. Ahead is what we know about <a href=# rel=noopener>Mariska Hargitay</a>‘s SVU salary and how much she makes per episode.

The season had 24 episodes, which means that Hargitay would’ve been paid around $540,000 for each episode. This is a raise from what Forbes reported was her salary in 2014. At the time, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes</a> reported that Hargitay made $450,000 per episode, which made her the second highest paid actress on TV that year.</p><p>In 2018, Hargitay was listed by Forbes as the 11th richest television actor, tying with Modern Family‘s Jesse Tyler Ferguson. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Celebrity Net Worth</a> reports that Hargitay is worth an impressive $100 million, which accounts for the roughly $540,000 per episode she makes from her Law & Order: SVU salary.

Hargitay is also the founer of the Joyful Heart Foundation, an organization she established in 2004 to support to survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and child abuse. As of 2011, the organization has raised more than $20 million for survivors.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Good Housekeeping</a> in 2010, Hargitay revealed that she was in debt before she booked Law & Order: SVU.“I had a house and car I didn’t want to lose,” she said at the time. “And I had a lot of credit card debt.” Money was so tight for her that Hargitay turned to her then-boyfriend for financial help. “When we broke up, he said I owed him 60 grand,” she said. “I’m a payer-backer. So as soon as I could, I paid him off. [N]ow I have learned to hang on to [my money]. I have a nest egg, and I don’t buy above my means.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Law & Order: Special Victims Unit</a> is available to stream on Peacock.
