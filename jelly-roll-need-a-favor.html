&#34;I only talk to God when I need a favor / And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer / So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I / To expect a Savior o-o-oh / If I only talk to God when I need a favor / But God I need a favor / Amen."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Need a Favor" tells the story of man on the verge of losing the love of his life. With nowhere else to turn, he looks to God to do him a favor, even if he doesn't deserve it.</p><p>"I only talk to God when I need a favor / And I only pray when I ain't got a prayer / So, who the hell am I, who the hell am I / To expect a Savior o-o-oh / If I only talk to God when I need a favor / But God I need a favor / Amen... Amen," he sings in the chorus.</p><p>The track is another prime example of Jelly Roll's earnest storytelling and humility. Like his previous single, "Son of a Sinner," we find a man in a moment of vulnerability finally coming face to face with his faults.</p><p>"I know Amazing Grace, but I ain't been livin' them words / Swear I spend more Sundays, drunk off my ass, than I have in church / Hard cover King James only been savin' dust on the nightstand / And I don't know what to say by the time I fold my hands," he sings in the first verse.</p><p>"Need a Favor" sits on a gritty rock melody. Both sonically and lyrically, the song feels like a prime track for the soundtrack of an upcoming Yellowstone episode. It's a different sound for mainstream country, but one Jelly Roll hopes will continue to leave its mark on the genre.</p><p>"They were in need of some country that wasn't, you know, truck-driven or hunting-driven, you know what I mean?" he tells&nbsp;<a href=#>Taste of Country</a>. "Nothing against those two things, those are my favorite songs. I enjoy both. But I think I brought that to the table too. It was, 'OK, we know we're going to get a little something left of center from Jelly.'"</p><p>His honesty looks to be catching fire. It's been a monster of a year for Jelly Roll, topped off with the success of his first single to country radio, "Son of a Sinner." Jelly Roll has also been an open book when it comes to his troubled past, in and out of correctional facilities dating back to his teenage years. Music is what turned his life around, and it's the reason he's giving back to kids just like him.</p><p>"I knew that I wanted to give back whenever I was in a situation to, and I always knew I wanted to make it really personal," he shared on the <a href=#>People Every Day</a> podcast. "So, I went back to the same juvenile that I started doing music at. I wrote some of my first raps there, had my first big rap battle there."</p><p>"It's important, man," he adds. "I think it's important that we give back, especially to our kids. Man, our youth are so impressionable, and the old quote goes, 'None of them asked to be here.'"</p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Top 22 Country Songs of 2022, Ranked</h2>There are plenty of feel-good country jams on this list of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">top country songs of 2022</a>, but the No. 1 song is one of the best love songs of the decade. These 22 songs are ranked by critical acclaim, radio and sales success, and importance to the genre.Seven of the 22 artists made our <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top Country Songs list from 2021</a>, as well, but there are no song repeats. If a song made a previous list (or didn't spend most of its time on the charts in 2022), it's not eligible. So, before you ask where your favorite song is (i.e. Cody Johnson, "'Til You Can't"), be sure the miss isn't just a technicality.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo52cocZuvs6lo2amlZqxbq2Mn5ivp6Jk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
