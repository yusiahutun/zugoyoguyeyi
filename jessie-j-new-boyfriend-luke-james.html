Sharing a cute photo of herself and Luke on <strong>Instagram</strong>, Jessie made her new romance known by captioning the snap: "My first ever official #mcm. My man. My crush. My Monday morning. So it's only right. @wolfjames." The 26-year-old looked to be on cloud nine as she was pictured cuddling up to her boyfriend and smiling sweetly at the camera.</p><p id=eGNMJVa_ieMO data-wc=3><strong>PHOTOS TO ENLARGE</strong></p><strong class=fr-embedded><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/86569a6ccb34-jessie-j1-z.jpg></strong> <strong></strong><p id=eC2CxwAJ4bBO data-wc=9><strong>Jessie J and her new 'man' singer-songwriter Luke James</strong></p><p id=etQ3k3JSpP1f data-wc=80>Luke, likewise, echoed her sentiments by posting a selfie on the picture-sharing site with his "babe" Jessie in the background. "Problem? lol | my bro @mrjewelzxavier and my babe@isthatjessiej and I mobbing my city streets. #neworleans | never too much fun! #Love | #LukeJames," Luke, who has written songs for stars such as <strong>Britney Spears</strong>, Keri Hilson and Justin Bieber, wrote. Jessie has recently revealed that her <a class=hm-link href=#>bisexuality was just a "phase"</a> and that she resented being defined as an artist by her sexual orientation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/0416d0b7f64c-jessie-j2-z.jpg><p id=eY_7Yje3F9gt data-wc=13><strong>Jessie J has previously said she was 'bored' of talking about her sexuality</strong></p><p id=eJcrZ9iaGFFQ data-wc=127>"I did talk about it, and I was open about it, and I do support being lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender – love who you want," she said. "That's what I'm doing. I don't regret anything I ever said, but I never knew back then that whatever I said became a fact that I couldn't change. "I'm just so bored of it, and that's kind of it – <a class=hm-link href=#>I want to stop talking about it</a> completely now and find myself a husband." Jessie also took to Instagram on Monday to announce some more exciting news. The Bang Bang hitmaker will be <strong>back on tour</strong> in the UK next year, playing shows in Glasgow, Newcastle, Leeds, Manchester, Birmingham and London. "What a perfect way to start 2015!" Jessie captioned a photo of herself striking a pose.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8c3yQbWhqaGRnfnh%2FlWihnqujnrJutoynnLBlkqTGp77InqWdZZyquKZ5yZqknqtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
