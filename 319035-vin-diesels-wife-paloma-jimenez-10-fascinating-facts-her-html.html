She's a Mexican-American by nationality</h2><p class=align-left>To answer the question "where is Paloma Jimenez from?" let's take you back a few years in the quaint town of Acapulco, Mexico. She was born on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">August 22nd, 1983</a> and the model and actor has embraced her Latina roots over the years despite living in the USA for more than twelve years and counting.</p><p class=align-left>From a young age, Paloma knew she always wanted to be a television star of sorts and her parents supported her dreams fully. Lucky for them, this was clearly her best-suited career path as she quickly excelled in it. So what is Paloma Jimenez's age? Well, she is now 34 and still very relevant.</p><h2>3.

Like her husband, Paloma is also an actress</h2><p class=align-left>We first got to really have a feel of the model’s<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> television prowess</a> from her popular Mexican show dubbed "Otto Rollo; Adalramones."

Her marriage to Vin Diesel is pretty hushed up</h2><p class=align-left>Almost everyone interested in the couple's life often asks, Is Paloma Jimenez married to Vin Diesel? If at all you are a fan of Mexican shows or fashion industry shenanigans, then you know Paloma as the longtime lover of Vin Diesel. The two have been together since she relocated to the USA. It was even rumoured that he was the reason she moved cities in the first place.</p><p class=align-left>At some point, tabloids claimed that the two had separated due to cheating allegations on Vin Diesel's part.

Paloma is the mother of three children</h2><p class=align-left>Through her union with Vin Diesel, the couple has been blessed with three adorable children.
