The official story at the time was that she was let go because of the show's falling ratings, but speculation was that it had more to do with her being even more likable to viewers than Lauer, and that <strong><a href=#>Lauer himself had a hand</a></strong> in showing her the door.</p><p>Almost as quickly as the news of Lauer's firing spread was the phrase "Somewhere Ann Curry" trending on Twitter, used to imagine how Curry was reacting to Lauer's sudden dismissal.</p><p>Below are six more Matt Lauer moments that have not aged well.</p><h2 class=h2>When He Dropped His Pants in Front of 'Today' Show Co-Hosts</h2><p>In December 2014, Lauer and all the "Today" show anchors put on a sketch called "Today: The Musical." In the middle of the skit, Lauer dropped his pants -- in front of all his female coworkers.</p><p>"Drink it in ladies! Get it while it lasts," he said.</p><p>It was all intended to be cheeky fun, but now people are finding it awkward to watch and circulating it on social media. Unlike one woman's accusation that <strong><a href=#>Lauer dropped his pants and exposed his penis to her in his office</a></strong>, Lauer is wearing a large pair of boxers in the skit.</p><h2 class=h2>When Katie Couric Told Andy Cohen About His Butt Pinching Habit</h2><p>During a 2012 episode of Bravo's <strong><a href=#>"Watch What Happens Live,"</a></strong> host <strong><a href=#>Andy Cohen</a></strong> asked Lauer's longtime "Today" show co-host <strong><a href=#>Katie Couric</a></strong> what his "most annoying habit" was.</p><p>"He pinches me on the ass a lot," she replied.</p><p>That won't play well for Lauer in the court of public opinion.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0fd28d17-3ab1-5543-90f7-47fa143baf8c data-container-ref=toofab:article:9c7ea9e5-b0a9-5565-87ee-97f539c5d0df data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/22/5by4/2017/11/29/2220ae71953d59e899f1208dd442b163_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Fox/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Wendy Williams Hopes 'Today' Won't Replace 'Lecher' Matt Lauer with a Woman</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>When Conan O'Brien Coined Him 'Creepy'</h2><p>In 2014, <strong><a href=#>Conan O'Brien</a></strong> added a segment called "Creepy Matt Lauer" to his show after Lauer gave an incredibly awkward interview at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.</p><p>Lauer was interviewing skiier Mikaela Shiffrin, who had just turned 18 at the time. For starters, Lauer pointed out that she "won a world championship at the tender age of 17." At the end of the interview, Shiffrin thanked Lauer and said, "Nice talking to you." Lauer then paused for an uncomfortable amount of time and smiled before giving a long-winded "You, too."</p><h2 class=h2>When He Mocked Sexual Harassment in a 'Today' Show Sketch</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Throwback to 2012 when Matt Lauer was the ‚Äúreal victim‚Äù of sexual harassment on the Today show ü§î <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/mYdnhEV2wv</a></p><a href=# rel=noopener>@TheDailyShow</a><p>Back in 2012, Lauer and <strong><a href=#>Willie Geist</a></strong> mocked sexual harassment in a jokey "Today" show sketch. Jeff Rossen of "Rossen Reports" played along, demonstrating where and when Geist "smacked him right on the tush."</p><p>The video shows makeshift surveillance video of smack. It also shows that Lauer smacked him back.</p><p>"I was standing by the doorway of the vestibule, and Willie came out, and I just said, 'Hi. Hi, Willie. How are you?'" Lauer said in a somber voice. "And I thought that would be the end of it, and then he reached out, and, you know..."</p><p>Roker then suggests the cameras "go to <strong><a href=#>Dustin Hoffman</a></strong>" so they could "ask his opinion" of the situation, which is also ironic given the <strong><a href=#>recent sexual harassment allegations made against him</a></strong>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e5570b8c-13e7-5875-8197-c81ab0a8c41b data-container-ref=toofab:article:9c7ea9e5-b0a9-5565-87ee-97f539c5d0df data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/64/5by4/2017/11/29/64f7a369fd6258d38aa1e5f1b01a47c9_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">ABC/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">'The View' Is Not Having Donald Trump's Tweets About Matt Lauer's 'Today' Termination</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><h2 class=h2>When He Asked Anne Hathaway About a Photo Paps Took Up Her Skirt</h2><p><strong><a href=#>Anne Hathaway</a></strong> was a guest on the "Today" show to talk about her role in "Les Miserables" back in 2012. The first thing Lauer brought up was a paparazzi photo taken of Hathaway getting out of the car at the premiere. The shot was taken from a low, upward angle.</p><p>"Anne Hathaway, good morning. Nice to see you. Seen a lot of you lately," Lauer began the interview.</p><p>"Let's just get it out of the way," he continued. "You had a little wardrobe malfunction the other night. What's the lesson learned from something like that other than you keep smiling, which you always do?"</p><h2 class=h2>When He Interviewed Bill O'Reilly About Being Fired Over Sexual Harassment Allegations</h2><p>This one's just spooky. And paints Lauer as a huge hypocrite.</p><p>Six months after being fired from Fox News over allegations of sexual harassment, <strong><a href=#>Bill O'Reilly</a></strong> appeared on a live "Today" segment</p><p>"I want to put this in perspective timing wise," Lauer said in September 2017 interview. "You were fired about 10 months after <strong><a href=#>Roger Ailes</a></strong> was let go by the network over allegations of sexual harassment. So the network understood the subject matter. You were probably the last guy in the world that they wanted to fire because you were the guy that the ratings and the revenues were built on. You carried that network on your shoulders for a lot of years, so doesn't it seem safe to assume that the people at Fox News were given a piece of information or given some evidence that simply made it impossible to for you to stay on with Fox News?"</p><p>Note: Lauer's firing makes "Today" the second major morning show rocked by the ongoing sexual harassment scandal that has swept through Hollywood and the media since October. <strong><a href=#>Charlie Rose</a></strong> was fired last week, leaving his "CBS This Morning" co-hosts in a similar state of disbelief. On Wednesday, <strong><a href=#>Gayle King</a></strong> reacted to the Lauer bombshell by saying she had "a sickening feeling of deja vu."</p><a id=gallery-link-6b2b9a09-58df-50e3-bcc5-64fd8aa3555a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:6b2b9a09-58df-50e3-bcc5-64fd8aa3555a data-poster-image-ref=toofab:image-asset:image_jpg_20171016_bf9a0238a4015a4198a48d322594fd39 data-start-at-poster data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:9c7ea9e5-b0a9-5565-87ee-97f539c5d0df data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bf/4by3/2017/10/16/bf9a0238a4015a4198a48d322594fd39_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlfnh7kGpma3Ffa3qiw8qwmKucXaKutcCMpZiunaJiurC5xKerrGWkna61ecearZ5lnqTBbq3Gnptmr5WhuW6%2FyKeanmWel7BussiroKefXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
