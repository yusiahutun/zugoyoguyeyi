After experiencing my first burnout from lack of sleep at the mere age of 24, I vowed to prioritize good rest. No Netflix show, no gripping book, and no night out with friends will rob me of my sleep.&nbsp;Just me in a set of cozy pajamas to help me drift away into REM sleep.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">And I’m not the only one with this sentiment. In her book “Thrive,” Arianna Huffington writes about the importance of having a trusty pajama set to turn to when night falls, because, at minimum, it serves as a signal to her body that it's time to "shut down" and assist her in getting a good night's rest. To her point, great pajamas should make one comfortable enough to doze off ASAP and sleep uninterrupted by itchiness, chills, or excessive body heat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Basically, bedtime-wear should be something we look forward to putting on each evening — good sleep depends on it. For some that may mean opting for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bamboo pajamas</a> or silk sets, but if you don't have any specific material requirement, any of the following cloud-like pajamas will feel great on the skin. And while lines have been getting a little blurry between <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>loungewear</a> and sleepwear lately, we're firm believers that there needs to be a clear distinction between bed clothes and couch clothes. To help you find your perfect pajamas, we sourced options that are comfortable, warm, and stylish.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-jcrew-end-on-end-cotton-long-sleeve-pajama-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Long Sleeve Pajama Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="J.Crew End-on-End Cotton Long Sleeve Pajama Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ktPNvR41iY0lyOloRVF0q3yf4mQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jcrew-end-on-end-cotton-long-sleeve-pajama-set-c84d9a3c9c004e03945dd28f573b8000.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>J.

Because of its menswear inspiration, it loosely hangs on the body, giving us elevated&nbsp;"Risky Business."&nbsp;The pajamas do run large, adding to the comfort, but for those who prefer something more fitted, be sure to size down.&nbsp;Fit aside, though, made from 100 percent cotton, the pajama set will keep you cool and comfortable throughout the night, regardless of the season.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Cotton |<strong> Size: </strong>XXS–3XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-silk-lunya-washable-silk-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Silk</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lunya Washable Silk Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lunya Washable Silk Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yxNyuNSagQUgiFVmkRNz-DZyvjA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lunya-Washable-Silk-Set-a28033c0430c4e33bfe7431b8b95dea2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lunya</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The mulberry silk not only feels good, but does good for your skin as well.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love:</strong> Although it’s washable, it does still wrinkle a little.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lunya's silk set is our all-time favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>silk pajama</a> pick for its softness and airiness. Made of 100 percent washable mulberry silk, the pajamas actually can help to smooth out wrinkles and keep breakouts at bay (more on that below). You’re investing in better sleep&nbsp;and&nbsp;adding to your skincare routine. And if you still aren’t sold, then consider their eco-conscious business practices. They work with responsibly sourced fabrics and less harmful dyes to protect our earth.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lunya designed this set to keep your temperature regulated during sleep, too, by using two panels of fabric in the back that create a breezy cross. The shorts also feature side slits for easy movement during sleep (tossers and turners, this one’s for you). While the description does say that you can machine wash the fabric, some reviewers pointed out that it does still wrinkle once dried.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Mulberry silk | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–2XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tencel-eberjey-gisele-tencel-modal-long-pj-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tencel</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eberjey Gisele Long PJ Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Eberjey Gisele Long PJ Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JgtJG9Oo2hLUEoJ6y66R7_SK-pw=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/amazon-eberjey-gisele-long-pj-set-55374586b0aa4fe5b9111a47aa6b3666.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They have a wide selection of colors to choose from.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>While the color range seems to be endless, the size range unfortunately is not.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nearly 900 five-star reviewers,&nbsp;InStyleeditors, and celebrity stylist&nbsp;Britt Theodora&nbsp;recommend Eberjey, which has also been a&nbsp;favorite of Oprah&nbsp;before because they make quality and comfortable PJs you’ll never want to take off. And we really mean that — one InStyle writer gushed that “this set is my unofficial uniform — I’ve actually spent an entire weekend wearing this around the house.” Inspired by a classic menswear pajama silhouette, the loose fit allows you to comfortably relax into the material. You can even add a custom monogram for an additional charge so that you and your family or friends can have personalized yet matching pajamas. And if you have 17 family members, worry not, as there are that many color options as well. That being said, the set only goes up to a size XL, which is not as inclusive as the color range.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As a sustainable material, TENCEL™ can be considered the eco-friendly alternative to cotton (not to mention it’s also softer). Similar to cotton, it, too, regulates temperature by expertly absorbing moisture, which allows the body’s natural thermal regulating system to function without interference.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p>Material: TENCEL™ Modal, spandex |<strong> Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>17 | <strong>Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-victorias-secret-flannel-long-pajama-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Victoria's Secret Flannel Long Pajama Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=800 data-sizes=750px alt="Victoria's Secret Flannel Long Pajama Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NjBJ4Ug14eVNQ6r5FFrksYw-k6k=/fit-in/1500x800/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Victorias-Secret-Flannel-Long-Pajama-Set--6743413094a743319c9e98ebd9210cd8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Victoria's Secret</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There is a wide variety of colors, sizes, and lengths to choose from.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>Reviewers think the flannel feels lightweight, so it won’t be warm enough for super cold nights.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Chlöe and Halle Bailey put not one but two Victoria’s Secret items on their&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>holiday wishlist</a>, so now I want a Victoria’s Secret pajama set as well. It comes in 14 different colors and patterns, as well as three length options: short, regular, and long. Not to mention for a two-piece set, $40 is truly a steal — the kind of price that won’t keep you up at night (see what I did there?). Instead, you can rest your tired body in their comfortable cotton and modal blend material. Reviewers, however, pointed out that the flannel feels a bit lightweight, so it may not be warm enough for the dead of winter.<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Cotton, modal |<strong> Size: </strong>XS–XXL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>14 | <strong>Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-la-ligne-bonne-nuit-pajamas></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>La Ligne Bonne Nuit Pajamas</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="La Ligne Bonne Nuit Pajamas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/u4I-YkxYuVC4I9R2xkvyJBDdxKI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/La-Ligne-Bonne-Nuit-Pajamas-66d7756a4775458ca53304d4e040bbf5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>La Ligne</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can personalize this piece by adding a monogram.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It’s final sale once you monogram it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re going to splurge on pajamas, choose a brand that knows what they’re doing. La Ligne's founders,&nbsp;Vogue&nbsp;editors Valerie Macaulay and Meredith Melling, take timeless, classic pieces and give them newfound life by adding a modern twist. Clearly, their mission is evident in the Bonne Nuit Pajamas made from 100 percent cotton. This evening staple comes in six classic colors, each of which has drawstrings around the waist and contrasting piping.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For those of us who like to put our name on things, the brand allows you to monogram up to three letters on the front pocket in their signature chain stitch. You can choose between ten colors, too. It does come with an additional $35 charge, but considering your name probably won’t change that often, it’s a detail worth investing in. Just remember that monogrammed pieces are final sale, so there will be no turning back. But to ensure you don’t have buyer’s remorse, you can preview your design before committing to the look.<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Cotton | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>6 | <strong>Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-skims-soft-lounge-sleep-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Skims Soft Lounge Sleep Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Skims Soft Lounge Sleep Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/sH9sqD9wIMh3R-mvStTO0lXirqQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/SKIMS-Soft-Lounge-Sleep-Set-65b5c9c8b7104ca3a2ef138224702b4d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Skims</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The blend of modal and spandex make this set extremely comfortable and soft.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The sleeves and pants may feel a little long on petite people.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One thing we know about Skims is that they deliver in terms of softness — reviewers say they hate taking off the set because of how comfortable it is. Made with a blend of modal and spandex, it’s both soft and stretchy. The slouchy, oversized fit makes the set universally comfortable regardless of your body shape. That being said, petite people might find the pants and sleeves a little long. The model pictured is five foot nine and wearing a size small, and the hem reaches the floor even on her. Considering you’ll be spending most of your time horizontal in this set, we don’t think the long hem will be too bothersome, maybe even comfortable!<strong></strong></p><p>Materials: Spandex, modal<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>XXS–4XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>3 |<strong> Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-satin-parade-dream-wide-leg-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Satin</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Parade Wide Leg Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Parade Dream Wide Leg Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/IiCZ8xJrL-4zKrweaB_YvA5QbH8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/parade-dream-wide-leg-pants-c703bd3877bc461a8aac2bea373e70eb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Parade</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The waistband is extra stretchy and comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It is not sold as a set, so you will need to add the top to the cart as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Typically made of silk threads, nylon, or polyester, satin tends to be soft and luxurious, but at the same time, when made from synthetic materials, it is less prone to wrinkles and will maintain its shape for longer. For extra comfort, the elastic drawstring stretches easily without cutting into your waist. There is a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">matching cami</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">long sleeve</a>, which you would have to purchase separately. And if you prefer these in shorts, they offer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">those as well</a>. Pick between the two prints and three colors to find your perfect fit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material:</strong> Recycled polyester, elastane | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–3XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Set: </strong>No<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cotton-petite-plume-luxe-pima-cotton-wide-leg-pajamas></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Petite Plume Wide Leg Pajamas</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom Petite Plume Luxe Pima Cotton Wide Leg Pajamas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/lTNTlswbSd-8YwTdahDjs2KtMsM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/petite-plume-luxe-pima-cotton-wide-leg-pajamas-d35dd947cfd04ec3b43193f276c98c12.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The pima cotton will feel extra soft and breathable.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It’s only offered in one color.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Made with 100 percent super soft pima cotton in Peru, this breathable set will keep night sweats at bay. The cropped wide-leg pants and sleeves contribute to its breathability while looking chic and cozy. An elastic waistband keeps things fitted without feeling restrictive as well. It’s such a classic and chic pajama that we can’t help but wonder why it’s only offered in white. Surely they could have offered us a navy or a pink option as well. Regardless, we’re confident slipping into the relaxed set will instantly drift you off into a lazy sleep.<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Cotton |<strong> Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1 |<strong> Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-organic-cotton-bedhead-pjs-festive-tartan-long-sleeve-classic-woven-cotton-portuguese-flannel-pj-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Organic Cotton</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BedHead PJs Portuguese Flannel PJ Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BedHead PJs Festive Tartan Long Sleeve Classic Woven Cotton Portuguese Flannel PJ Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/nozNOJG8YonqrGTJOEgtryTSVLs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bedhead-pjs-festive-tartan-long-sleeve-classic-woven-cotton-portuguese-flannel-pj-set-850ac454a7b542cd82a30b59110514e1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BedHead PJs</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The organic Portugues cotton feels extra soft and warm on the skin.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It may shrink in the wash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love a classic red flannel pajama, especially as the holiday season comes up. Festivities or not, however, the organic cotton used to make this pajama makes it a wonderfully soft option to snuggle into every night, no matter the season. You’ve got everything you could possibly want in a flannel set, including the button-down top with a collar and chest pocket, and drawstring pants that are neither too slouchy nor too fitted. The brand does warn, however, that the material was not pre-shrunk before your purchase, so it’s likely it may shrink in the wash.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Organic cotton |<strong> Size: </strong>XS–3XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bamboo-cozy-earth-short-sleeve-bamboo-pajama-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Bamboo</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cozy Earth Short Sleeve Bamboo Pajama Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cozy Earth Short-Sleeve Pajama Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/W1Iu9iJ6nETzfHGa-PZs_O_dJSg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cozy-earth-short-sleeve-pajama-set-9945dc86d71842c69c0e7af59f485b04.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cozy Earth</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It has a 100-night sleep trial with easy returns.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It comes with a lot of stretch and an oversized fit.

The material absorbs 40 percent more moisture than even the finest cotton, keeping you comfortable and cool throughout the night. But you can also feel good about buying them, too. Bamboo requires less water to grow than cotton, and because it sprouts like weeds, farmers don’t need to replant it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After wearing them for a while, you probably won’t want to go back to another set of PJs, but if you decide they’re not for you, Cozy Earth offers a 100-night sleep trial, which allows you to return the pajamas if they don’t live up to the hype I’m giving it.

The Italian label simply never misses where quality fabrics and sultry cuts are concerned. Take this velvet satin camisole as an example. While from the front it may seem like any other standard silky camisole top, the back portion holds over each other, leaving a tiny open space at the lower back. Adjustable straps allow you to keep the pieces fitted to your body’s measurements. While you can get the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">matching shorts</a> to create a set, we’re disappointed to see it only offered in this one purple color.

Along the waistline, you’ve got all the classic features of boxers: an elastic waistband, a label at the front and center, and three buttons going down. The pants fall down in a loose fit, giving that relaxed appeal that we all love in pajamas. Made with a blend of viscose and organic cotton, the pants are satisfyingly drapey, silky, and soft — basically everything you want to sleep in. Be aware that you can’t machine-dry these pants as they will likely shrink.

It’s like sleeping in nature’s embrace — refreshing, natural, and relaxing to the soul. We love linen for its lightweight, breathable capabilities year round: in the winter, linen retains your heat without constricting airflow, while in the summer, it keeps your body cool and comfortable. Linen also happens to be one of the strongest natural fibers (about 30 times more rip-resistant than cotton) and will retain its quality while resisting rips and tears for years to come. It also happens to be one of the few materials that only get softer with every wash, so you’re investing in a forever piece here. This button-down long sleeve is both soft and stylish, so much so that you can wear it both in and out of the sheets. There are&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">matching pants</a>, but you will need to purchase them separately.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p>Material: 100% flax linen | <strong>Size: </strong>S–3XL | <strong>Colors: </strong>14 | <strong>Set: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-printed-linen-the-lazy-poet-emma-olive-zebra-linen-pajamas></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Printed Linen</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>The Lazy Poet Linen Pajamas</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Lazy Poet Emma Olive Zebra Linen Pajamas" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/R9g3EVtRqtfZ6pU7vi4U1JOxo9c=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/The-Lazy-Poet-Emma-Olive-Zebra-Linen-Pajamas-f9dc11d3827840419463acd7833a76c5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The set is filled with unexpected, charming details, like purple embroidery on the sleeves that read “unconditional love.”</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The sleeves and pants are cut a little short.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At first glance, we were captivated by the earthy green zebra stripes, but then we started noticing all of the tiny details, like the contrasting purple piping along the seams. The same purple stitchings can be found on the cuff of the left sleeve, with embroidery that reads “unconditional love.” Much like the previous option, the 100 percent linen fabric will only get softer with each wash. If you find it looking a little crinkly after tumble drying, just let it sit on a hanger for a few hours, and the wrinkles will naturally fall out. The material allows the pajamas to naturally drape but be aware that the sleeves and the pants are cut a little short.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Linen | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>|<strong> Colors: </strong>1 |<strong> Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lace-anthropologie-silky-lace-slip-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lace</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anthropologie Silky Lace Slip Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anthropologie Silky Lace Slip Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/inAMV12IH-eEh0XgZp8wm5dj13M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anthropologie-silky-lace-slip-dress-568d9d5401e844a38b57e199d8e26b05.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Lace cups are tied together with a tasteful bow in the middle, making this chic and seductive.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>You can’t machine wash or dry this item as it may shrink and crinkle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Have you ever slept in a silky lace slip dress? I have, and let me tell you it makes you wake up in a good mood every single time (if it’s warm enough, that is). And the one I own isn’t half as pretty as this slip dress from Anthropologie — with lace detailing around the cups, a bow to tie the center together, and a silky bodycon dress that’s neither too fitted nor too loose. It’s almost too pretty to confine it solely to the bedroom, but perhaps some treats are more valuable when you get to keep them to yourself. Be careful not to machine wash or dry this, however, as it can both shrink and crinkle.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Viscose |<strong> Size: </strong>XXS–XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1<strong> </strong>|<strong> Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-sleeve-gooseberry-cozy-pj-set-ivory></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long Sleeve</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Gooseberry Cozy PJ Set Ivory</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Gooseberry Cozy PJ Set Ivory" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/G1yk0AP6pXAEmTMgEC9E8I9pXrM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/gooseberry-cozy-pj-set-ivory-a8e0e3b6001c46b28b8b4f82ad5bee83.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gooseberry</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Soft jersey cotton will feel like a soft stretchy embrace.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>There aren’t a lot of size or color options.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I love a good long-sleeve short set, and this soft jersey cotton option feels like a snuggly embrace you’ll never want to let go of. And rather than a simple all-white set, there are cute contrasting pink piping around the seams. Thanks to the top-to-bottom buttoning on the shirt, you can open the whole shirt up and wear a cute camisole underneath as well. However you choose to wear it, you’ll enjoy both the comfort and the endearing look this provides. It doesn’t come in a lot of sizes or colors, but we hope you find what you need in what’s offered currently.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Soft jersey cotton<strong> </strong>|<strong> Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>3<strong> </strong>|<strong> Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-printed-cosabella-bella-short-sleeve-top--boxer-pajama-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Printed</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cosabella Short Sleeve Top & Boxer Pajama Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Cosabella-bella-short-sleeve-top--boxer-pajama-set style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/eoU2c-gqk3uDKanOe-65lckm9is=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cosabella-bella-short-sleeve-top--boxer-pajama-set-8f60f18121a64a09a6353d34adcf6c3f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>You can choose between different sleeve and pant length sets.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>It runs a little small, according to the reviews.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When you’re ready to have a little fun with prints, the pajamas over at Cosabella come in various ones, including this tiger design, a Himalayan flower drawing, some jazzy triangles, and more. They’re made in Peru using Pima cotton and are equal parts cute and comfortable.

The top features a chest pocket with satin piping along the collar and lapels. A common sentiment amongst the reviews, however, is that this set runs a little small.

I find that menswear-inspired clothes often provide a comfortable and relaxed fit that is just missing in a lot of women’s apparel. This borrowed-from-the-boys boxer brief set allows you to enjoy both the aesthetic and the comfort in a more tailored fashion. These shorts come with a supportive elastic waistband that sits high up around the waist, while the matching tank continues to hug your silhouette, showing off your curves in all the right ways. An important thing to point out, however, is that the company is run by a single woman, which is why the product can take anywhere from four to six weeks to deliver. It will be worth it, though.<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Cotton, polyester |<strong> Size: </strong>XS–3XL<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Set: </strong>Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-boxers-comme-si-la-boxer-alta></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long Boxers</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Comme Si La Boxer Alta</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Comme Si La Boxer Alta" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ooCkv6eImwE4Def9NMIq6pdT3k0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Comme-si-La-Boxer-Alta-1c565d7608a546f5bd944eef7483fa2a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Comme Si</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The pants can double as cozy loungewear as well<strong>.</strong></p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>They might be too long for petite women.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">More from the boy’s club are these long boxer pants.

And I’m ready to add these dreamy Italian cotton pants to my collection. Something about them makes me want to hang around in bed all day, reading the newspaper and drinking coffee. Their signature label can be found at the front of the waistline with two buttons down the front in a classic boxer style. Boys and girls alike will find comfort in this timeless piece — with a unisex silhouette that works for all genders. Just make sure to inspect the size guide properly — the brand states the inseam is 32 inches for a size medium, so they’ll be too long on anyone who is petite.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Cotton poplin |<strong> Size: </strong>XS–XL |<strong> Colors: </strong>3 | <strong>Set: </strong>No</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-knit-nia-joan-sweater></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Knit</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nia Joan Sweater</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nia Joan Sweater" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-mkPccvKf0uBX5Lb171faUx6h-M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nia-the-Brand-Joan-Sweater-bf7c112b5a794d0d968e705e438879b5.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nia</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s perfect for cold winters when you need some extra warmth.</p><p><strong>What We Don't Love: </strong>The size range is not that inclusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For all my cold friends, we haven’t forgotten about you.

But that admittedly feels a little silly when I could just get knitted pajamas instead, so for my benefit (and ultimately, yours), I found this Joan sweater. This cable knit sweater, with its dropped shoulders and flared sleeves, has matching long pants as well to keep you warm on top of the thick polyester and wool combo — even if the top has a bit of a boxy and breezy cut to it. We wish it came in a larger size range, though, because at the moment it only goes up to a large. However, it at&nbsp;least has an oversized fit, which can cover a few sizes under one cut.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p><p>Material: Polyester, acrylic, wool, spandex | <strong>Size: </strong>XS–L<strong> </strong>| <strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Set: </strong>No<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material<br></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you get a recommended eight hours of sleep every night, you sleep for four months of the year.

When we sweat during the night, natural fibers are ideal as they are more breathable, sweat absorbing, and must be cleaned less often than synthetics.” Wellness influencer Arina Negisihi seconds this statement, explaining, “I get hot and cold while sleeping, so cotton is the best when it comes to trapping and wicking moisture from my body.” Options to try include <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Lazy Poet Emma Olive Zebra Linen Pajamas </a>and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lunya Washable Silk Set</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What are the best pajamas for winter?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Leitz recommends natural fibers for winter pajamas, explaining, “These fabrics are not only warm but cozy against your skin.” Cotton can be woven into a thicker material, which makes it a great year-round fabric to turn to. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Nia the Brand Joan Sweater</a> is a great winter pajama that is thick and soft.

What causes skin breakouts on the body are oils, sweat, dirt, and dust, which materials such as cotton absorb and become a breeding ground for bacteria. Silk does not absorb oil, dirt, mold, or allergens and can keep the skin cool and dry throughout the night.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Elaine F. Kung says she loves silk and another material, linen, for this reason. Sleeping in linen leads to less sweating, which results in fewer body acne breakouts. "It’s one of the most eco-friendly and cleanest fabrics due to its antibacterial and dirt-repellent properties,” Kung says.
