When praying, you do not ask for things from God aimlessly. Instead, one has to identify the things to pray for, where prayer points for a crusade come in.</p><h2>Prayer points for a crusade</h2><p class=align-left>You can’t keep praying for just one thing when there are so many things you can pray for. Prayer points can vary based on the unique characteristics of the audience. Below are prayer points for a successful crusade:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3a81a148637556c6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best opening prayers for school assembly before classes</span></p></a><h3>1. Crusade opening prayer</h3><p class=align-left>The best prayer points in preparation for a crusade program acknowledge God's presence from the onset. An opening prayer serves to ask God to take charge of all the crusade activities from the beginning to the end to ensure its success.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Join</a> TUKO.co.ke Telegram channel! Never miss important updates</strong></p><h3>2. Crusade closing prayer</h3><p class=align-left>Everything with a beginning must have an end, and so is the case for a crusade. Since the crusade started with a <a href=#>word of prayer</a>, it is to also end with one. Thank God for his guidance and protection throughout the crusade, and ask him to lead everyone home safely.</p><h3>3. Ask God for boldness to witness</h3><p class=align-left>Miracles happen every day, but without God blessing us with boldness to witness, we may not be able to witness them. These are the prayer points for an upcoming crusade to help members to see the good work of the Lord. By witnessing, Christians will see the good deeds and spread them far and wide.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0101dae3359bd0ed.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 powerful prayers for ladies' fellowship meetings and luncheons</span></p></a><h3>4. Thank God for the privilege of your calling</h3><p class=align-left>The truth is that not all people show interest in crusades even when they are in their vicinity. Therefore, this prayer point is for the minister to thank God for being called to lead his flock. It is also thanks to the almighty for making members of the crusade heed the call to attend.</p><h3>5. Pray to break loose from every inherited evil curse</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3a81a148637556c6.jpg><p class=align-left>Many of those attending crusades are people seeking answers from God as to why their lives are filled with misfortunes even as they are prayerful. To answer them, you have to pray for them to break loose from every inherited evil curse derailing their progress. Once they have been set free, they will be able to realize all of God's goodness.</p><h3>6. Thank God for crusade members</h3><p class=align-left>A crusade is not a crusade if people do not attend. For a crusade to be successful, it must attract many congregants hungry for the word of God. The work of God is evident in the big crowds he sends to crusades to witness his word hence he should be praised for that.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d349cd5654a5c050.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Sabbath school opening prayers for worship or church service</span></p></a><h3>7. Ask God for opportunities</h3><p class=align-left>People want to see the results of the blessings spoken unto them at the crusades. God is kind and gives to those who ask. Therefore, a crusade is a perfect place to ask the Almighty to <a href=#>provide opportunities</a> for all those in the crusade. Through those opportunities, they will give back to God to thank him.</p><h3>8. Ask God to give those present faith to believe</h3><p class=align-left>People will hear the word of the Lord, but without faith, they will not believe it. Therefore, pray to God for the gift of faith so that those present will listen and believe His word. In the same way, let their faith be seen through good deeds because the Bible says faith without action is dead.</p><h3>9. Ask God to bless the families of crusade members</h3><p class=align-left>All people want their families to grow in number and wealth. A crusade, therefore, dedicates a prayer to God to bless not only those present but also all their <a href=#>family</a> members. Rebuke the spirit of sickness from their families so that they may have<a href=#> good health</a> and long lives.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2f8ddcff1481d034.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15+ best closing prayers for church services and meetings</span></p></a><h3>10. Thank God for providing deliverance from bondage</h3><p class=align-left>The chains of bondage have enslaved many people who are forced to serve Satan instead of God. Those that have mustered the courage to come to the crusade have God to thank because he is the one who has delivered them from bondage. Therefore, prayer should be said to thank Him and ask Him to continue protecting all his people.</p><h3>11. Seek God’s mercy and forgiveness</h3><p class=align-left>No matter how perfect we think we are, we will always be imperfect in the eyes of the Lord. Therefore, we should use every opportunity to seek his mercy for our shortcomings. This prayer is important because it is through God's mercy and forgiveness that we will be able to avoid the fire of hell.</p><h3>12. Call on God to cover crusade members with the blood of Jesus</h3><p class=align-left>Sin and evil are always knocking, and it is easy to find yourself giving in to them. Only the blood of Jesus can keep you safe by keeping evil from you. Since Christ shed his blood on the cross for us to be saved, we shouldn't have to suffer again, which is why we make this prayer.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/b89f97269fdafea6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 powerful prayer points for church workers on Sunday morning</span></p></a><h3>13. A prayer for cleansing</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0101dae3359bd0ed.jpg><p class=align-left>While God and others may forgive us, it is more difficult to forgive ourselves. Therefore, prayer for cleansing is to help all crusade members get rid of their guilt and burdens. In a crusade, such a prayer can be done by incorporating symbolic actions like washing feet or faces to signify the cleansing of individuals.</p><h3>14. Pray for peace</h3><p class=align-left>There are millions of people worldwide who do not know what peace is because of ongoing wars. Make this a prayer point for a crusade to pray for such people to have a taste of peace in their lives. It is also an opportunity to thank the highest for the relative peace and calm in your life.</p><h3>15. Ask God to bless crusade members with giving hearts</h3><p class=align-left>Even in bountiful times, some people are constantly struggling to get by. Giving is a powerful prayer point for a crusade as it encourages participants to develop a compassionate and unselfish spirit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f4b07a6e9ffcf320.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 best prayers for Sunday School teachers and students</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This will motivate them to give freely to the less fortunate and the church without condition. Crusade members can also be encouraged to pray for a specific needy cause to help them connect on a deeper level.</p><h3>16. Prayer for little children to grow knowing God</h3><p class=align-left>Little children occupy a special place in the kingdom of God hence they should also be encouraged to attend crusades. Use the opportunity to pray for them so that they may remain with the humility they were born with as they grow. Pray for their faith to grow so that they may worship none other than God.</p><h3>17. Prayer for the spirit of community</h3><p class=align-left>All churches design their worship to take advantage of the spirit of the community. A crusade is not done for individuals but all members of the community. Therefore, it is the perfect place to encourage those present to appreciate and participate in their community.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a182d8dbe7ae80e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15+ powerful good morning prayers for him to wake up to</span></p></a><h3>18. Pray for truth</h3><p class=align-left>Truth is the only thing that can set the soul free, and believers should always be encouraged to be truthful no matter what. Without prayer, people tend to have trouble accessing the truth in their souls and letting it speak freely. Invite those at the crusade to meditate and pray to address, accept and speak the truth.</p><h3>19. Pray for mothers</h3><p class=align-left>The church places a special emphasis on the role of mothers in raising children, following the example of Mary. She was a prayerful woman hence God chose her to be the mother of Jesus hence other women should be encouraged to have a similar relationship with God. This can work well as one of the <a href=#>prayer points </a>for an outreach program targeting women.</p><h3>20. Pray for the gift of love</h3><p class=align-left>It is the call of Christians to try and incorporate the love of God into all their affairs since Christ taught that love is the greatest of all gifts. The problem is that it is never easy for humankind to practice such immense love. Nevertheless, the many <a href=#>Bible readings</a> and psalms that address love can be used as prayer points for a crusade.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5a182d8dbe7ae80e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 strong opening prayer points for church service, Sunday, or worship</span></p></a><h2>Frequently asked questions</h2><li>How do you pray a powerful prayer?
