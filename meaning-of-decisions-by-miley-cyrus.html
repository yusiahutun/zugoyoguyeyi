Throughout the song, Cyrus and Borgore emphasize their desire to have it all and indulge in whatever they please, particularly symbolized by the metaphorical "whole cake." This theme of unapologetic self-indulgence is expressed through various standout lyrics that all contribute creatively to the overall message.One standout lyric from the song is "I'm not sharing, I'm not sharing, You should've learned how to bake." This lyric suggests a sense of possessiveness and entitlement, as well as implying that the other person should have made an effort to contribute rather than relying on others to provide for them. This idea extends beyond literal baking and can be seen as a metaphor for the importance of self-sufficiency and not relying on others for one's own happiness.Another notable line is "Decisions between a family or a porn star, Humble life or sports cars, Liver or the whole bar." This lyric presents a contrast between two seemingly opposing choices, highlighting the theme of excess and the desire to have it all. It suggests that one may struggle to make decisions between a conventional, familial life and a more extravagant, indulgent lifestyle. This lyric reflects the constant battle between what is expected from society and the desire to follow personal desires without limitations.The line "Your mom and dad might hate me, but in 5 years I'm the president" is unexpectedly imaginative and playful. It touches on the idea that societal disapproval or opposition can be overcome with ambition and the determination to achieve one's goals. The imagery of becoming the president adds a touch of fantasy to the song and reinforces the idea that anything is possible when one is driven by their desires and dreams.The lyric "Everyday's my birthday, 'cause bitches love cake" is catchy and captures the essence of the song's theme. It represents the insatiable desire for constant celebration and excess, as well as the idea that indulgence is always justified. It implies that life should be enjoyed to the fullest, and that one should never hold back from satisfying their desires, regardless of judgment or criticism from others.In summary, the song "Decisions" by Miley Cyrus delves into the theme of self-indulgence and the desire to have it all. Each standout lyric creatively contributes to this theme, exploring concepts such as possessiveness, the struggle of making choices, overcoming societal expectations, and the pursuit of constant celebration. Ultimately, the song celebrates the idea that life should be lived to the fullest, without hesitation or limitation, embracing one's desires and indulging in the metaphorical "whole cake" of life. It encourages listeners to make their own decisions and unapologetically chase what brings them joy and fulfillment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvCq5itoZNiuqbAx6ibZ5ufonyutcuesGabqafCtHvMnpinoZ6cerCyjJ2cnKGjnryvv4ybsGalmaGyunnCsqmuqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
