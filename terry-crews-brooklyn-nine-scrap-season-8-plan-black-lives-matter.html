In other words, they're rethinking the whole show, what it's about and what it should be saying.</p><p>"We've had a lot of somber talks about it and deep conversations and we hope through this we're going to make something that will be truly groundbreaking this year," he shared. "We have an opportunity and we plan to use it in the best way possible."</p><p>"We have to start over," he continued. "Right now we don't know which direction it's going to go in."</p><p>It's important enough that they realize they can't just ignore what's going on outside their windows in the real world.</p><p>Protests are ongoing, showing no signs of abating, and real change is beginning. This isn't just going to die down and everything goes back to normal, because it's that normal that protesters are fighting against.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:5069d8e0-ca02-47a5-9aff-0469aa330062 data-container-ref=toofab:article:267a4640-1037-4633-8004-f6956d094d63 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/30/5by4/2020/06/19/303a60cceb57492692adc0ae15552b2a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook Watch</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Willow Smith Speaks Out Against 'Cancel Culture' In Red Table Talk About Racism</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>So what do you do in a fictional world built around cops as heroes? It's a question facing so many shows right now at a time in America where there are calls to defund the police, and major questions rising about their reliance on violence and shooting, as well as the militarization of local police forces.</p><p>It's a complicated social issue that doesn't come with easy answers, but it's also a huge cultural moment that must be reflected in the stories that are told about law enforcement. And on television, there are so many of those stories every week, you can guarantee people will be looking to them to see what they have to say.</p><p>"This is an opportunity right now for us all to unite and get together and understand what this is and that we have to battle this together," said Crews.</p><p><strong>Got a story or tip for us?
