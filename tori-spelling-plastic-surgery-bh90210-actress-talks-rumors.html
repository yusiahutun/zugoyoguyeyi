I’m constantly reading that I’ve done more.” Although, these rumors aren’t new for the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beverly Hills, 90210</a> actress, they’ve been going on for quite some time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tori-Spelling-Plastic-Surgery-3.jpg><p>“People have been talking about me having plastic surgery since I was 17,” the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stori Telling author</a> explained. “I remember my dad [producer <strong>Aaron Spelling</strong>] saying, ‘Don’t worry. It will go away next week.’ But that one thing has stayed with me my entire career!” Growing up with her famous father also made Tori a lot more aware of how the public and the media perceived her.</p><p>“I always felt so misunderstood,” Tori revealed. “I was either Aaron Spelling’s daughter or I was [my&nbsp;BH90210 character] Donna Martin. I was nobody else. And it was really hard for me to get past that. And I became a people pleaser because if I didn’t smile it was like, ‘Oh the producer’s rich daughter, she’s a bitch. For me doing reality [shows], I could show people, ‘I’m just like you!’ I always thought if people could meet me, we’d be friends.” But time and experience has allowed Tori to accept how things are.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tori-Spelling-Plastic-Surgery-RUmors-2.jpg><p>“It’s fun to own it!,” she said. These days, Tori is quite happy with who she is, and is very confident — earlier this year she shared a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bikini photo</a> with costars&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jennie Garth</strong></a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Gabrielle Carteris</strong></a>. “Sunday family dinner … #nomakeup,” the blonde beauty captioned the photo. Although, some people bashed Tori for the snap, but her husband,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Dean McDermott</strong></a>, came to her rescue.</p><p>“I love how you haters have private [accounts]!” the Chopped Canada alum, 52, said in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">defense of his wife</a>. “Let’s see what you trolls look like [you] cowards!” Now that’s how to stick up for someone!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tpquhXai9prjLoqWgZaChrrTAyJxkrK2inLKzxYybn3JoYmZ9bq3Crameq6NiwaK4yqxkq62dpL%2B0ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
