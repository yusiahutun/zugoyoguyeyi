The couple exchanged their vows at their mountain-top estate in Stevenson Ranch, California, in front of 250 of their close friends and family. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-198 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>The couple first met at a charity event in 2004, and after two years of extensive dating, the couple got married and after about being married for about a decade, there is not a single chance of divorce as they are still on a strong bond.</p><p style=text-align:justify>On 26 March 2008, the couple welcomed their first child together; a baby boy and named him Malloy Adrian Smith. Later, on 29 September 2012, the couples welcomed their second child; a daughter named&nbsp;London Olivia.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-199 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><img alt height=400 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/From%20left%20to%20right%2C%20KJ%20Smith%2C%20Monique%2C%20Gwendolyn%20Osborne%2C%20London%20Olivia%2C%20Malloy%2C%20Kenny%20Smith%20and%20Kayla%20Brianna.jpg width=500 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>From left to right, KJ Smith, Monique, Gwendolyn Osborne, London Olivia, Malloy, Kenny Smith, and Kayla Brianna&nbsp;</strong>(Photo:&nbsp;liverampup.com)</p><p style=text-align:justify>The couples parented five kids altogether.

The split came out of nowhere and everyone got surprised. Kenny had cited&nbsp;irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Gwendolyn gunned&nbsp;for primary legal and physical custody of the couple’s two children:&nbsp;Malloy and&nbsp;London. And add to that, she demanded&nbsp;spousal support from Kenny.&nbsp;Spousal support essentially is alimony,&nbsp;financial assistance to help&nbsp;the recipient achieve financial independence.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Although the split, Kenny and&nbsp;Gwendolyn have gone public to say that they have ended their 12 years of marriage in good terms. They have decided to co-parent their children.&nbsp;</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>More On Kenny's Children</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Now let’s talk about their grown-up kids and let’s start with Kenny Smith Jr’s.

Although her decision left Kenny a little bit afraid, he still supports her and she already has many solo videos on her Youtube channel which currently has over 3 thousand subs.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-602 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>With a large family of seven, Kenny Smith also had his own reality show produced by TBS called ‘The Smiths’ which aired on 3 April&nbsp;2015 and ended on 8 May&nbsp;2015.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Kenny Smith is acting as an NBA studio analyst for TNT Sports where he joins with Charles Barkley and Ernie Johnson every week during the NBA season.</p><p style=text-align:justify>With that in line, Kenny is also the main studio analyst for the NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament on CBS and Turner.
