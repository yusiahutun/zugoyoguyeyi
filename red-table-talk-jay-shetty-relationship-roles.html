"The dependent is someone who goes, 'I want a parent, I want shelter, you make me feel safe, you make me feel taken care of, I'm gonna give you the key to my happiness in life.'"</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:bf6b195b-5af4-44ad-bd78-971e76ef63db data-container-ref=toofab:article:6c688343-953b-4e6c-9bdf-92213265fa90 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/09/5by4/2022/11/11/0997f95b64a24fd9b3b0efaefaf67d0d_xs.png width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith and Sheree Zampino Pay Tribute to Son Trey on His 30th Birthday</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The "Supporter," however, is the one he calls "the healthiest out of the three."</p><p>"We're going to support each other but we're going to remember we're still our own people," he says, explaining the final option. "So what most people do, when they get with someone, they are trying to force their version of home with someone else rather than saying, 'I want to build a home together with bricks I picked from mine and bricks I picked from yours.'"</p><p>His most recent appearance on RTT comes ahead of the release of his new book, "8 Rules of Love: How to Find It, Keep It, and Let It Go," out in January. Per Amazon, the book finds Shetty laying out "specific, actionable steps to help you develop the skills to practice and nurture love better than ever before."</p><p>A synopsis of his Red Table Talk episode says he'll also explain "his critical steps for finding love, building trust, healing from heartbreak, fighting with your partner and breaking up gracefully" -- adding, "Get ready for life-changing wisdom from one of the most respected and sought-after thought leaders."</p><p>The full episode drops Monday on Facebook Watch.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d377e026-e975-46d8-97cf-36aaea04a548 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6c688343-953b-4e6c-9bdf-92213265fa90 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f7/5by4/2022/10/20/f70d4d9e93d9471394cb180dbf9f87d1_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Facebook Watch / Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Will Smith and Sheree Zampino's Son Trey 'Didn't Feel Loved' By His Mother Growing Up</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGtmaXFfp7KledOamaWdXamurbeMo5iyZaOdsrXA2GapnqSRqbawutKhoKlloqS5pr%2BO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
