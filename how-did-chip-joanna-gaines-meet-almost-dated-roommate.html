I walk towards the waiting room and John, and I make eye contact. But I’m not really gifted in any conversation. So, I look at him and I’m like, ‘Now what?'” Joanna recalled.</p><p>“And so instead of going to the waiting room, I walk straight outside, like I was going to take a smoke break or something,” she continued. Then fate stepped in as <a href=#>the next person she saw was Chip</a>.</p><p>“Unlike her, I’m incredible at eye contact. I always have a one-liner planned for any occasion where you might meet one of the most beautiful women on the planet,” the home remodeler said of meeting his future wife. “You must have that back-pocket line ready to rock. So, she walked right past Hot John, thankfully, right into the loving arms [of me].”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/shutterstock_editorial_10528552a.jpg><p>“John’s tall, dark and handsome. I was sort of shorter, redder and frumpier,” Chip said with a self-effacing laugh. But he was charming enough that he won Joanna’s heart, as the pair began dating in 2001 and <a href=#>married on May 31, 2003</a>.</p><p>Chip has recalled previously how he was transfixed by Joanna before ever meeting her. After his initial trip to her dad’s tire shop, the HGTV star believed he’d found “The One” just by seeing a photo of her. “Her dad made the mistake of putting a pic of the family behind the counter at his [automotive] shop. I knew I’d marry her one day just by the picture on the wall,” he told <a href=#>PopSugar</a>.</p>He kept returning to the shop in hopes of finally meeting Jo face to face. <span>“My buddies used to always joke that no one could get their brakes done as often as I got my brakes done,” Chip told Waco TV station </span><a href=# rel=noopener data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>KWTX</a><span>.</span> <a href=#>After nearly 20 years of marriage</a>, Chip and Joanna <a href=#>have built an empire</a> that began with Magnolia Realty in 2003, the same year they wed.&nbsp;<i>Fixer Upper</i>&nbsp;debuted on HGTV in 2013 and went on to become one of the network’s top shows, as the couple bought, remodeled and sold homes around Waco.
