It does not include contributions to other branches of science, such as mathematics or theoretical physics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The latest ranking, based on scientific research output between February 1 last year and January 31, was topped by Harvard and dominated by Chinese universities, which contributed seven of the top 10.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Located in Guangzhou, the capital of the southern province of Guangdong, the university is relatively unknown outside China and academic circles. It ranked only 267th in this year’s QS World University Rankings, which measures performance across a wider range of academic disciplines.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the university’s strength in high-quality research has been on a dramatic upwards trajectory in recent years thanks to luck, ample research funding, and an aggressive talent recruitment policy that has drawn more frowns than applause.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to the Nature Index website, it ranked only 78th in 2018, but in less than five years its output in natural sciences more than doubled.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In contrast, universities such as Oxford and Cambridge, as well as American universities like Stanford and University of California Berkeley, are seeing a downward trend.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese scientists develop contact lens that monitors and treats glaucoma</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The unexpected performance of Sun Yat-sen University this year was in part due to a change in the statistical method used in the latest year’s ranking. Starting this year, the Nature Index database began including articles from 64 medical journals to track trends in health sciences and broaden coverage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The university has a strong medical tradition, and its provincial key laboratories and 10 affiliated hospitals have made many valuable contributions, aiding the rise in this year’s rankings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It has also been helped by increased funding as a result of its new Shenzhen campus, which opened in August 2020.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its total budget for 2021 and 2022 has been over 19 billion yuan (US$2.6 billion), putting it in China’s top five.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its research budget has also been increasing year on year. According to its website, it rose from 2.3 billion yuan in 2016 to 4 billion yuan in 2021.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But it has also increased its research and teaching staff, using unconventional – and sometimes controversial – methods to do so.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Since 2015, it has recruited a large number of young researchers using a different system from the common tenure-track employment system, which tends to offer a stable, long term-career path for researchers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead, Sun Yat-sen University employs researchers on a short-term basis, with far more employees than there are long-term positions available – a set-up described as “enter the university first, then compete for a job”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The researchers also face extremely strict assessments as they compete for these positions, resulting in a high turnover of staff.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some discussions online have suggested that only 10 per cent of academics are able to meet their targets and remain for longer than a year. Of those who remain, many more are forced to leave within three years. Critics have also complained that the low salaries paid to these academics is a form of exploitation.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Chinese university sacks academic over sexual misconduct claims</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“This ‘enter the university first, then compete for job’ scheme has caused dissatisfaction among young academics and has greatly affected the university’s reputation, receiving severe criticism on online forums,” according to Zhishifenzi.com, an influential science news website.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One academic, who asked for anonymity, said staff were not allowed to comment freely on the university’s policies and must gain permission before speaking to the media.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The university did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Initially named Guangdong University, the institution is named after its founder, the revolutionary leader Sun Yat-sen, who placed great emphasis on education and established it in 1924 to train researchers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In October 2001, the original Sun Yat-sen University merged with Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/27/26be2b25-1c11-4026-aa55-e148b1536a3f_ac707f82.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The report indicates around two thirds of its scientific output comes from domestic collaborations and around one third from international partnerships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/27/2f65c012-c49d-4cc1-915e-22e3fcebe473_a1ff5957.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Its top three domestic collaborators are the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Southern Medical University, and Zhejiang University. Internationally, the university collaborates with the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres, Harvard University, National University of Singapore and the University of Basel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Recently it has been trying to boost its strength in engineering subjects such as big data, artificial intelligence and robotics, as a part of Guangdong province’s higher education enhancement plan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The university has also set ambitious plans for further development. In a statement on its website it says that before 2030 it aims to become a “world-class university with integrated development of liberal arts, science, medicine and engineering, with extensive international influence”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelny0r8iepZydX5a%2FtbXCpZxoa2JngnZ8lWifqK9dmbalecueqqydomK4r7vWp2SuppmrsrO%2FyK2wZqufqsGpecKhoKeZXZeyosCMqK%2Bfp6KZeqStzJupopyXmnqiusNmsJqklWK7osDUq5ilZaOYtqa6wp5kq52jmq6zr8c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
