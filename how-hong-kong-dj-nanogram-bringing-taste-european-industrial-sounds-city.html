Nanogram says that at the time his music was “going in a more commercial direction”, and even the underground techno sounds that he encountered were “a relatively accessible part of the underground scene”."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They made it work in the club, which was really cool to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/15/134347cd-8a2f-4c7b-99a2-4fac8a818a92_a74d5e8d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nanogram says that at the time his music was “going in a more commercial direction”, and even the underground techno sounds that he encountered were “a relatively accessible part of the underground scene”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Techno was already in full flow in Europe at the time, but it hadn’t fully reached Hong Kong. The few techno clubs that existed in the city were small, with sound systems that left much to be desired.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Hong Kong’s indie music scene through the eyes of seven female artists</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The most developed scenes were obviously in the West, but these parties I went to in Japan and South Korea were extremely inspiring. Some of the Japanese venues were small but had impeccable sound systems which are essential to playing more layered music, and they took a lot of pride in what they did. It’s good to learn from our neighbouring countries.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2018, Nanogram founded his club collective, Entropy, and booked musicians with “hints of industrial influences”, whose work may be more accessible to the public ear.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He gradually transitioned towards “the next phase”, having felt “more confident to do what I wanted to do […] a one-of-a-kind sound system, programme and management of European standard”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/15/0122929e-ed77-4a22-ac10-b3760eb98912_2256693d.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What he truly wants is to introduce more left-field industrial techno shows to Hong Kong venues, such as “live performances with drones and ambient sets in-between”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I wouldn’t say that’s anything too innovative,” he says, “but it wasn’t around in Hong Kong much unless you went to small private warehouse parties.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In June 2023, Entropy celebrated its fifth anniversary with a special live performance at Mihn, in Sheung Wan, with Berlin-based duo Years of Denial, consisting of French musician Jerome Tcherneyan and Czech performance and music artist Barkosina Hanusova.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Led by Hanusova’s vocals, the duo explore the genres of post-punk, goth and industrial rock, in a mesmerising showcase of sonic and performative art. It was a rare event in Hong Kong and left a lasting impression.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I’d been following the band for years,” says Nanogram. “When I went to Berlin for the first time, in March 2023, and got to meet their agent, I pushed for an Asia tour. I think Years of Denial’s music aligns with my vision for Entropy.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Years of Denial holds sentimental value for Nanogram, having been recommended to him by Albert Leung, a vinyl store owner who died in late 2019. He met Leung while digging through the store’s records.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He imported all this industrial stuff, really cool records, and told me how the older generations in 80s and 90s Hong Kong would listen to British post-punk music. I learned a lot of interesting music history from him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/15/aa0373d3-c1a4-4c8f-9ff0-5d97c1e5ed2b_8c0e96d0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When it comes to his category of techno, Nanogram feels “sometimes people have these misconceptions about industrial music” as being loud, noisy and harsh. It is why he wishes to bring another side of the genre to Hong Kong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Years of Denial has this sort of romanticism that’s really interesting,” he explains. “Just because the culture and the scene have not yet boomed in Hong Kong doesn’t mean they aren’t meaningful.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Currently, aside from calling on Japanese, South Korean and European DJs, Entropy is led by Nanogram himself alongside resident DJ Yong Ying, who joined in April 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/15/71eded34-e26c-4e42-92c4-949546156198_5b24658c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nanogram says he saw “a very good instinct about mixing” in the young DJ, who started out only in 2021 but has already proven herself to be a worthy asset to the collective.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, Nanogram’s next experimental club night will see the arrival of yet another Berlin-based duo, Soft Crash, who will grace the decks at Mihn on February 23 – Pablo Bozzi, a music producer and “live artist,” and Phase Fatale, a resident DJ at Berghain, one of Europe’s most infamous techno clubs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Nanogram says the event will be “euphoric” and “uplifting with Italo disco influences”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/02/15/e641106e-2065-438a-99e3-2a49359c7b94_872f0c95.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He adds: “I like thriller, horror and sci-fi movies. And being born in Hong Kong, I’ve always loved our city’s brutalist aesthetic, but it doesn’t reflect in the music. Industrial sounds can be heavy and intense, but they can also be a moving and emotional musical experience.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOmqmtq12iwrS1wmiYq6yZmLmme5JrbGtoaGd8qbvWZp%2BoppdiuLC6xmabo2Welruws9GapGaaop67qLXNoGStmaOpsm6x1KumqZ2Ro3qqusOuqq2qmZa5br%2FOrqWdq12YtrXF</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
