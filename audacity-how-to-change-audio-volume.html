A recording might sound too quiet, or some parts louder than others, but luckily you don't have to throw it away and start again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are several easy ways you can change the volume of the audio in Audacity, depending on your situation, and below we will show you how.</p><h2 id=adjust-the-gain-slider>1. Adjust the Gain Slider</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/audacity-tips-db-slider-increase-gain.jpg><p>One of the quickest ways to boost the volume is to change the gain slider on the audio track. It's located on the left-hand side of the editing timeline underneath the <strong>Audio Track</strong> and <strong>Mute</strong> buttons. By default, the slider is set in the center, but you can move the slider towards the <strong>+</strong> sign on the right to increase the gain, and move it to the <strong>-</strong> sign on the left to decrease it.</p><p>Changing the slider won't change what the audio looks like in the editing timeline, but you will hear the difference. It also isn't a permanent change, so you can move the slider back to 0 dB at any time to reset the audio gain to its original level.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This method has its limits though; the most you can boost the gain is +36 dB, or -32 dB if you want to reduce it. More importantly, using this method will apply the volume change to the entire track. If you want to adjust the volume of just one selection, you will need to create a new track or try a different method.</p><p>Note that audio gain is similar to volume but can mean different things when using a DAW. If you need a quick refresher, read our <a href=#>explanation on gain versus volume</a>.</p><h2 id=normalize-the-audio>2. Normalize the Audio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/audacity-tips-volume-normalization.jpg><p>To normalize audio in Audacity, select <strong>Effect > Normalize</strong> and set <strong>Normalize peak amplitude</strong> to the level you want. Click the <strong>Preview</strong> button if you want to check what it sounds like, and click <strong>OK</strong> to apply the change. Take a look at the screenshot above to see the difference in volume before and after normalizing the audio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Normalizing a track in Audacity will change the volume to reach a set target. You can use it to increase the overall volume of your audio, or apply it to a collection of different audio files so that they all roughly sound "normal". In other words, there isn't one track that sounds wildly louder or quieter than another.</p><p>By default, the <strong>Normalize peak amplitude</strong> setting is set to -1dB which is a good place to start. In a nutshell, the volume of the entire selection will increase until the loudest part of the audio, also called the peak, reaches the target of -1dB.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/audacity-tips-normalization-dialogue.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keep in mind that increasing the volume of your audio will also make any background noise in the track louder. This effect works both ways too, so if you want to decrease the volume, set a target that is lower than the peak amplitude (the loudest point).</p><h2 id=use-the-amplify-effect>3. Use the Amplify Effect</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/audacity-tips-effects-amplify.jpg><p>The Amplify effect in Audacity can produce the same results as Normalize, but there are some reasons why you would choose this option and not the other. To use this effect, highlight your audio selection and select <strong>Effect > Amplify</strong>. Once again you have the option to <strong>Preview</strong> or select <strong>OK</strong> to apply changes.</p><p>Now let's take a look at the options in the Amplify dialogue window. First, there is the option to change the volume of your track using the slider, or if you prefer to enter an exact dB number you can do so as well using the two input boxes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/audacity-tips-amplify-target.jpg><p>By default, the first box labeled <strong>Amplification (dB)</strong> will show you how many dBs you need to increase the volume to reach the target of 0.0 dB. This target is set by the second box labeled <strong>New Peak Amplitude (dB)</strong> and changing one will affect the other.</p><p>All in all, that gives you three ways to change the volume: you can increase the volume by dB's in the first box, move the slider to change the volume, or set a target volume using the second box.</p><p>The most important difference between Normalize and Amplify is how it affects the left and right channels of a stereo track. With Normalize, both the left and right channels will be changed independently to reach the target level. With Amplify, however, the volume for the left and right channels is changed by the same amount.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-method-should-you-use>What Method Should You Use?</h2><p>All three methods will work to increase or decrease the volume of your audio, so which method should you use? While it depends on the situation, there are some general guidelines you can follow.</p><p>For a start, the<strong> Gain Slider</strong> is great for applying small changes in volume to an entire track. But once you start putting more than one audio clip on a track, you might only want to change one particular section. If that's the case, then use <strong>Amplify</strong> or <strong>Normalize</strong> to permanently increase the volume of a selection without changing anything else on the track.</p><p>Out of the two options, choose <strong>Amplify</strong> if you want to turn the volume of a track up evenly for both the loud and quiet parts. On the other hand, use <strong>Normalize</strong> right at the end of your workflow to make sure that your track sounds similar in loudness to other tracks you might hear on Spotify, for example.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are lots of <a href=#>creative uses for Audacity</a> and as you develop your audio editing skills, you'll learn exactly when to use each method.

There is more than one way to do it too, each with its own benefits. Now that you know what these volume-changing effects and tools are, you can start mixing your audio for even better results.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiYrpyRmLa1xYyhprBlpKR6pLTAp56eZZGqsaq7jK%2Bmpa2dmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
