&#34;Little More You&#34; features the organic instrumentation that has dominated much of Josh Abbott Band's work, including fiddle, banjo, touches of steel guitar and an emphasis on electric guitar. Those elements create a pleasant, down-home country sound that's paired with an electronic drum beat, juxtaposing traditional and modern production touches."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His vocals are as warm as ever as he sings about needing more time with the woman he loves, and that's the strongest aspect of "Little More You." Relaxed and inviting, his vocals are enough to have you smiling along with the song.</p><p>The lyrics are a sweet ode to simply wanting more time with the one you love.</p><p>"I said this cup could use a little more whiskey / This porch could use a little more swing / This week could use a little more weekend / And we could use a little more Hank / This world could use a little more country / The sky could use a little more blue / Those bees could use a little more honey / And I could use a little more you,"&nbsp;Abbott sings in the chorus.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> "Little More You" is the&nbsp;lead single from Josh Abbott Band's upcoming EP,&nbsp;Catching Fire.</p><p><h3>Josh Abbott Band's "Little More You" Lyrics:</h3></p><p>It was right about sunset / She was sitting pretty on the front step / She said, "Hey baby, are you done yet? Are you gonna work all day?" I started walking up the driveway / She said, "I'm headed inside, babe" / Before the screen door slammed / She turned and asked if I needed anything</p><p><strong>Chorus:</strong><br>I said this cup could use a little more whiskey / This porch could use a little more swing / This week could use a little more weekend / And we could use a little more Hank / This world could use a little more country / The sky could use a little more blue / Those bees could use a little more honey / And I could use a little more you</p><p>Trees swaying when the wind blows / Record playing in the window / Yeah we're taking it real slow while the crickets sing for us / She's got her legs hanging over me / There's no telling where the night might lead / When your kisses are sweet as sweet can be / I can never get enough</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><p>Oh these arms could use a little holding / And yours could use a little more too / But we both could use a little more loving / And I could use a little more</p><p><strong>Repeat Chorus</strong></p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>NEXT: Top 40 Country Songs for July 2019</a><p><strong>These Country Artists Are Keeping Traditional Country Alive:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo6ejnXqirsGoq61lkpa7pXnLoqutpJViurC%2BxGawqK1f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
