incorporated “all necessary safety features”, the Telegraph reports. <span class=Apple-converted-space></span><br></p><p>The school is set to have obscured windows on the ground floor in a bid to prevent sex offenders from looking at youngsters. <span class=Apple-converted-space><br></span></p><p>It will be surrounded by an 8ft high fence with gates which only open for an hour each morning and 45 minutes in the evening when kids arrive and leave. <span class=Apple-converted-space><br></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

said: “Issues with the probation centre having service users who have to report to the building that could place them in breach of court and probation orders by being so close to a school have been raised. <span class=Apple-converted-space></span><br></p><p class=p2>“The enhanced risk of having a pool of young people quite so close to people known to offend with children is, I believe, a great
