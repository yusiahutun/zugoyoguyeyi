While they said it was "never planned," Alex said it did end up being a little "weird" after the fact.</p><p>"It was the days when we used to have to share hotel rooms. In Europe, they have the two twin beds, they don't even split them apart. So, it's almost by force," Alex joked. "We were forced into these scenarios by the European government because they don't separate their beds.
