“When we got there he had the most perfect conditions, there was a heatwave at the time and the water was so flat, I thought ‘I could do this’,” Hu said.
The swim from the south of England to the north of France in August 2022 was Hu’s first step in conquering the Triple Crown of Open Water Swimming; three of the world’s most difficult open water swims."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She went to Europe earlier that month and could not turn down the opportunity to swim the English Channel, but the conditions “were not as good” as her friend had.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hu said her swim started at 2am and the water was much colder than when she was supporting her friend a few days earlier.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The water was really choppy but after a few hours the sun came up and it reinvigorated me and gave me the drive to keep going,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/29/78b731d5-4215-49d9-b94a-ec34e4c06c12_b3ee84ec.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hu completed the 21-mile swim in 12 hours and 36 minutes and just 10 days later, she was in New York swimming around the 20 Bridges.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The swim around the island was once notorious for being one of the dirtiest, with previous athletes finding everything from a dead chicken to a grapefruit and even a dead body.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My dad got me some anti-parasitic medicine but I ended up not taking it because the water was surprisingly clean and flowing,” Hu said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Also known as the 20 Bridges Swim, the track around the island is about 28.5 miles, the same distance as the route around Hong Kong Island, which Hu has also completed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She finished the Manhattan Island swim in eight hours and 16 minutes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“After I finished it within 10 days of each other, my friends were looking at the Triple Crown online and they told me that if I could swim the Catalina Channel within the next 18 days, I could break the world record for fastest completion of the Triple Crown,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/29/64eb1101-702b-4923-a00d-e3c765daf35a_8827594b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hu wrote to the swim’s organisers, but was told applications needed to be handed in 40 days before, and they were unwilling to bend the rules, despite world record being on the line.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, the extra time to prepare for the 20 mile swim from Catalina Island to the California mainland, which began at 11pm on September 10, paid off.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The Catalina Channel was the most difficult for me,” Hu said. “There was a constant current pushing against me and at one point my hands started to stiffen into a claw shape.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It took her two hours longer than anticipated to complete the swim, finishing with a time of 14 hours and 33 minutes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born and raised in the United States to Chinese-born parents, Hu has lived in Hong Kong for the past 16 years and said it was the city’s open waters that made her fall in love with swimming again.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“When I was at school in California and during my childhood I was always swimming in pools, in competitions and taking summer classes,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I just kind of got burned out from having what I call structured swimming, having a coach tell me what to do and swimming back and forth in the pool.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/09/29/739c6945-6767-4d7c-b518-52b3b7aab33e_b1955660.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hu had never done any open water swimming before moving to the city in 2007, but taking part in a couple of short open water swim races led to her joining a swim group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She was instantly hooked, and started checking off some of Hong Kong’s most famous swims, including the Shek O Challenge, the Clean Half solo and the Polson 5.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She even became the first woman to complete the Cold Half in 2016, a 15km swim starting at Stanley Main Beach and finishing at Victoria Recreation Club, Deep Water Bay, swimming in 16-18 degree waters.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Now, Hu has her sights set on the rest of the Oceans Seven – seven of the world’s most difficult swims – having already completed two of them in the Triple Crown.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“But I do not know when I will be able to do it, I’m nearly 50 now and I do not want my arms to fall off,” she said. “And flying around the world to finish these swims is really expensive.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As well as the English Channel and the Catalina Channel, the Oceans Seven includes the North Channel between Ireland and Scotland; the Cook Strait between New Zealand’s North and South Islands; the Moloka’i Channel between Moloka’i and O’ahu; the Tsugaru Strait between the Japanese islands of Honshu and Hokkaido; and the Strait of Gibraltar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Hu plans on doing the Strait of Gibraltar – swimming from Spain to Morocco – in 2024.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, she said she does not think she looks like an athlete and wants to promote body positivity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I am not a skinny or muscular swimmer, I am not lean and I don’t look like a triathlete, I’m a little chubby, actually and this has helped me, I’m more buoyant and it keeps me warm,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A lot of people think that because of their body shape, swimming isn’t for them, but actually it is very forgiving.”</p><p
