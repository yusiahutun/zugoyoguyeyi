I was four or five, and in kindergarten.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Most things you love about fashion Anna Sui did first</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My whole childhood was spent thinking about how to get to New York and become a fashion designer. I would ask my mother to buy Vogue at the grocery store and I would save all these articles. My babysitter would bring Seventeen magazine.</p>In Life magazine, there was an article in the late ’60s about two young ladies who’d gone to Parsons School of Design and after they graduated they moved to Paris, where <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Elizabeth Taylor</span></a> helped them open a boutique. Seventeen had an ad for Parsons every month and I wrote to them and got the registration catalogue. I changed my curriculum at school and started to take art classes to build a portfolio. I did everything I needed to go to Parsons.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">My mum’s first reaction was, why do you want to be a dressmaker? If you have brains why don’t you go to college to become a doctor or lawyer? But then they saw how determined I was, and my father even took freelance work to help pay my tuition. They were very supportive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/04/08d1d295-3bd5-4955-a2dc-589d629ec89e_0e7de8d3.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Going underground</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I went to Parsons in the mid-’70s, my priority was living in New York and enjoying New York and that’s when I met (photographer) Steven Meisel, who was in another department at Parsons. We started going out every night. I guess that was part of my education: learning about New York underground life.</p>We would go to Max’s Kansas City (a nightclub), where Andy Warhol hung out. Then Steven’s best friend from childhood joined a band, we went to see them and it was Patti Smith, and we would see Blondie, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the Ramones</span></a>, Talking Heads, and a lot of the English bands coming over.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/04/095735c4-a327-4525-83af-43fbd75bb710_32b1757b.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">I want that job</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After my second year at Parsons, I had overheard a senior talk about a job that was available and I thought, “I want that job”, so I got it and never went back for my senior year. I dropped out and worked for the company for more than a year as a designer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I had all these friends making jewellery and selling it to cool boutiques and I wanted to do something like that, so they said, “Why don’t you make a line of clothing?” I made a small collection of five pieces and ended up selling it to a lot of boutiques. At that time, Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s were very fashion-forward and both picked up my first collection. This was 1979-80.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/04/1011d660-96b9-4ad1-96ce-8090bf1f3565_a1efec09.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Madonna’s surprise</h3>In 1990, Steven asked me to go to Paris with him to see the fashion shows. The first one we went to, we stopped at the Ritz to pick up <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Madonna</span></a>. We were waiting in her living room when she came out of the bedroom with her coat on and we rushed into the car and to the show. Then she said, “Anna, I have a surprise for you.” She was wearing one of my dresses.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That was shocking to me because in her room there were racks and racks of clothes and shopping bags from every designer in Paris, so I thought, “I can’t wait to see what she’ll be wearing”, and it turned out she was wearing my dress. That gave me a lot of confidence and, when I got back to New York, Steven said, “Now it’s your turn, you have to do your own show.”</p>I had no money, resources or connections but he helped me. I knew Naomi Campbell, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Linda Evangelista</span></a> and Christy Turlington socially through Steven because they worked together and we would hang out and go to dinners and parties. Linda and Naomi helped me get the other models and Garren did the hair and François Nars the make-up. That was my first show, in February 1991.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/04/9f1da359-1676-4303-b7ea-159fd5bf6b9c_12a69b9d.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">The man from Isetan</h3>Around that time, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">New York Fashion Week</span></a> became very international. A lot of press was coming and the Japanese stores were coming. I got pursued by every Japanese manufacturer and store and trading company but I really liked the president in charge of Isetan (department store). He loved my collection and came to me with a proposal to not only distribute but also bring along 12 licences for me – one of them was cosmetics.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The first time I had been to Japan, I was invited by a manufacturer who wanted to produce my collection and have me work from there and when I arrived, they said, you’re going to be surprised because everyone is selling counterfeit Anna Sui T-shirts. Even news-stands on every street corner were selling fake Anna Sui T-shirts. I was crying, thinking this was going to ruin me, but it had actually made me famous.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/04/5d23b339-f167-44ee-b7b2-13ca2f31e5b2_22810d24.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Home sweet home</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One day in 1992, a friend who was working at Calvin Klein and lived down the block in Greenwich Village said “I have an idea for you. People don’t understand your clothes. You don’t fit next to Calvin Klein or Bill Blass, you need to show people what you’re about so you need to open a boutique.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The next day, I went to SoHo and found the space where I would have my boutique for the next 25 years, which established what the Anna Sui brand was all about, with the red and purple floors, black-lacquer furniture and packaging for the cosmetics line. It was the best idea that anybody ever had that I should do the store. I had no money and we painted the furniture and walls ourselves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/04/796cd308-a7ed-4cad-a390-2721434761f7_e79612c1.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Rock-star quality</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was always interested in the boutiques in London that were dressing all the rock stars. I would comb through newspapers and magazines to see what the Beatles and Rolling Stones were wearing and I started reading names like Ossie Clark and Biba. I always had this one focus: I wanted to design for rock stars and their girlfriends, it’s the type of clothes I’m attracted to and what I always keep in mind for every collection. No matter what the inspiration is, it always goes back to that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/03/04/fa6b0b8a-6300-4626-b492-8f4b4f35b9b9_12a69b9d.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Exploring China</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was last in Beijing opening an Anna Sui Active store at SKP mall in January 2020, and we could hear people talking about Wuhan. I was so used to travelling to Asia two or three times a year and it was always so exciting because China has changed so much over the years.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I was also trying to explore other parts of China because I had always gone to Shanghai and Beijing. Once I went to Guizhou with my mum and we saw the Miao people and the way they lived. The last trip we took together was to Dunhuang to see the painted caves and the desert. It was spectacular. I am looking forward to doing more trips like that and discovering more about Chinese culture.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOn5isoJmku3Ct0a2gnKSVZIBygphrampnkaO7onnSrqBmnpGotaq7zWabnquZnLumvoybnKKml2K2r7%2FPoqmenF2irqW7zaeY</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
