So, the singer subtly addressed the elephant in the room before performing the track during his Fontainebleau grand opening celebration performance earlier this week.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>People</a>, Timberlake appeared to give his ex a quick and subtle shoutout before he and his band played the song. "No disrespect," he said to the audience, which also included Timberlake's wife, Jessica Biel.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Spears addressed the track, which accuses her of cheating on Timberlake, in her memoir <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Woman In Me.</a> "I felt there was no way at the time to tell&nbsp;my side of the story," Spears wrote. "I couldn't explain, because I knew no one would take my side once Justin had convinced the world of his version. I don't think Justin realized the power he had in shaming me. I don't think he understands to this day."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The book dropped other bombshell truths about their romance, including that she had an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>abortion</a> while they were together. The revelation was initially reported by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a> who received an advanced excerpt of the book. “But Justin definitely wasn’t happy about the pregnancy. He said we weren’t ready to have a baby in our lives, that we were way too young,” Spears revealed, adding that if it had been her decision she "never would have done it" but that "Justin was so sure that he didn't want to be a father."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Timberlake's 2018 book Hindsight, Timberlake said his "strong" feelings towards the breakup compelled him to write the song in two hours. "I've been scorned. I've been pissed off," he wrote. "That feeling inspired me to write 'Cry Me a River.'"&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ya6qraGeYsGqucGeqaWZm5p6pL7YZqSeZZFiv6rCxKtkpZmjYsOms8CsZJuqmam7psWMrKeemaKoenmAkG9scnE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
