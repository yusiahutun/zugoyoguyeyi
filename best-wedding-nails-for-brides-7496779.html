Though it might seem trivial in comparison to hair or makeup, it’s actually essential, especially when you consider what a focal point your hands will be throughout the day (your photographers have to get that ring shot, after all).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Traditionally, the most popular colors for brides tend to be pale pinks, soft nudes, and sheer whites,” says Julie Kandalec. “These colors are popular because they are elegant and understated, and they complement a wide range of bridal styles and color schemes.” Pale pink not necessarily your style? There are still plenty of shades to choose from to ensure you feel like the best version of yourself on your wedding day.</p><h3 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__heading>Meet the expert</h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And remember, there’s no wrong choice when it comes to picking your mani shade —&nbsp;anything goes. “Whatever color you choose, the most important thing is to wear it with confidence,” says Kandalec. “ A solid manicure done right —&nbsp;cuticle work, polish, shaped, and glossed with top coat —&nbsp; needs nothing else.”&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From pops of color to metallics and everything in between, Kandalec and Sonya Meesh break down some of the best wedding nails for brides. Keep reading for inspo as well as some expert tips on how to make your mani last through the big day and beyond.&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sheer-baby-pink></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sheer Baby Pink&nbsp;</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Always a classic, this ultra-feminine shade is soft, romantic, and complements a wide range of bridal styles and color schemes, as well as a variety of skin tones, says Kandalec. With that in mind, let your skin tone be your guide. “A warm-toned bride might choose a peachy-pink shade, while a cool-toned bride might opt for a blush or baby pink,” she suggests.

If your look is more sweet and subtle, go for a pastel; brides that like to bring the drama should consider a bold cobalt or a deep navy.

This hot new shade is cooler in tone and a bit more muted than regular lavender. "Digital lavender was named by trend forecasting website WSGN along with sister company Coloro as 2023’s color of the year, so we've been seeing it everywhere,” says Kandelec.

Go with a metallic. Kandalec loves rose gold in particular: “It’s a warm and romantic hue that complements warm and cool colors alike,” she says. “It’s great for brides who want to achieve a super modern look, or perhaps compliment some of the colors in their overall decor.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, silver and gold are also classic picks; Kandalec recommends using them as french tip shades, for nail art, or just as a simple accent nail. “Both colors give elegance and opulence to a finished nail look,” she adds.

Holographic nail colors aren’t just sparkly — they practically glow with a rainbow luminosity, so you can guarantee your mani will pop on your wedding day, even under dim lighting.&nbsp;We like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>KBShimmer Nail Polish in A Hint of Manila</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>ILNP Ultra Holo Nail Polish in Chai Latte</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-white></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>White</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You can’t go wrong with white, especially if you’re wearing a white dress — it’s classic, elegant, and timeless, perfect for a glam yet traditional bride, says Kandalec. It also comes in a range of opacities (we love a milky white shade) and suits all skin tones. “For example, brides with fair skin may opt for a stark white shade, while brides with darker skin tones may prefer an ivory or off-white shade” she adds.

A clean-looking nail with a coat of a treatment-based formula will support your nail health while ensuring your fingertips look finished — all without making you feel like your hands are “overdone.” Try <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Manucurist Paris Green Treatment Polish in Active Glow</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Londontown KUR Illuminating Nail Concealer</a>.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-make-your-wedding-manicure-last></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to make your wedding manicure last</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Durability is key to a chip-free manicure, so Kandalec highly recommends opting for gel lacquer or a structured manicure with a gel overlay, both of which are strong and will last. Timing your nail appointment carefully is also key. “For example, if the wedding is on a Saturday, the rehearsal dinner is usually on Friday,” says Kandelec. “I would say get the manicure on Wednesday or Thursday, because it will be close enough to the wedding and can last full into the honeymoon.” If you’d rather stick to regular polish, do it as close to your wedding day as possible —&nbsp;think the day of your rehearsal.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another clever idea to make your mani last well into your honeymoon is layering a gel formula with a traditional lacquer. “You can do a gel polish for the honeymoon and go over it with a regular polish you can wear for the wedding, then just take that polish off,” suggests Kandalec. So long as your nail tech has a good understanding of layering polishes and uses a non-wipe topcoat over your gel manicure, this is an easy way to ensure you have a manicure that can last for weeks —&nbsp;all you’ll have to do is take off that coat of normal polish.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re someone that hates a manicure emergency, it’s still worth packing your nail shade and a topcoat in your travel kit, particularly if you opt for regular polish. “<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>CND Vinylux</a> is a great brand because it's a long-wear topcoat and polish, and no base coat is needed,” adds Kandalec.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6qrWWnmrGltc2gZKeZmaHAbrLOq2SbqpmZsrR5lm1wb29nbg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
