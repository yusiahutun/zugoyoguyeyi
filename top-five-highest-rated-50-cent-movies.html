Music <a href=#>changed</a> his life after living most of his early life on the streets and around crime and drugs.</p><p>The album produced by music greats Eminem and Dr. Dre was a huge commercial success selling 9 million copies. It <a href=#>featured</a> hit singles like “Wanksta” and “In Da Club,” which had solid hooks and became crossover pop hits.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.pinimg.com/564x/0d/cc/15/0dcc15cfa84e439308803de047033d6b.jpg><p>Also, his “gangsta” rap style appealed to many people, and so did his appearance, looking muscled and tattooed. In addition, most of his lyrics stem from real-life experiences, which makes them relatable to most people.</p><p>In 2005 he released his second album, “The Massacre,” which became another hit.
