Little Big Shots, for those who aren’t familiar, is a competition series that&nbsp;allows kids to display their unique and jaw-dropping talents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/melissa-mccarthy4.jpg><p>Producers of Little Big Shots were yearning to give the show a total makeover, and adding her as the new host will offer a chance for a “real refresh,” Paul added. “Melissa is just an incredible performer and incredible comedian, and she’ll bring a really fresh perspective to it.”</p><p>The news of the Oscar-nominated star’s new gig — which will return to the air at 8 p.m. on Sunday nights following the conclusion of football season next winter — comes just days after <a href=#>Steve was canceled by the network</a>. The syndicated talk show recently taped its final episodes, which will air through June, according to <a class=external-link title="(opens new window)" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-describedby=external-disclaimer><i>Variety</i></a>, with reruns airing through September.</p><p>Steve’s daytime show, which aired on NBC for seven seasons, will be replaced by&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a>‘s new talk show, <i>The Kelly Clarkson Show</i>. Despite the sad news, he will thankfully still continue to host <a href=#>Family Feud</a> and Celebrity Family Feud. Steve isn’t going anywhere, folks!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/steve-harvey-kelly-clarkson.jpg><p>Although the news may not have been that surprising — Steve previously expressed uncertainty over whether the show would stay in the network — he&nbsp;admitted that the official departure was heartbreaking. “I thought I was [staying] until they made an announcement a couple weeks ago that they wanted to give Kelly Clarkson the owned and operated NBC Networks, and that’s my slot,” he said during an interview at <i>Variety</i>‘s Entertainment Summit in January.</p><p>“I’m an honorable guy and I’m just an old school guy and I just thought that you’re supposed to talk to people and go, ‘Look, you’ve been good business for us. This is what we’re thinking of doing. Are you OK with that?’ No, you don’t just put something in the paper and say, ‘I’m gonna make this move right here’ because it’s crazy,” he said. “You look at the numbers on.”</p><p>No matter what, we’re sure great things are in Steve’s future!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46mnKWho6iubrnCnJirrJiuerOxz6WYnKGenHq0wMSvnGagkafDpsWMmqpmpJmpwa2xjJugoGWjnby1v4yhpqysXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
