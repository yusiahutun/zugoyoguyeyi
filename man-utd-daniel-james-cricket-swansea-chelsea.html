Coaches of the £15million winger, who scored on his United debut on Sunday, recalled the 'beehive football' when the then 13-year-old left opponents chasing him &#34;like bees round honey&#34;.
Former Swansea man James’ former PE teacher Matt Simpson, of South Hunsley School, told SunSport: “Daniel played for our U11s and he stood out from an early age because of how quick he was."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They were like bees round honey trying to catch him up.”</p><p>Now, the jersey <a href=#>James </a>wore when he scored his first goal for <a href=#>Wales</a>, against Slovakia in March, hangs in the halls of South Hunsley school.</p><p>Simpson, a family friend from the same village, noted James’ gradual progression throughout his teenage years.</p><p>But the 21-year-old has seen a rapid rise over the past two years that culminated in his big money move this summer from <a href=#>Swansea City</a> to the Theatre of Dreams.</p><p>I remember the East Riding county manager at the time used to call it ‘beehive football’, because as soon as Danny got the ball you had six or seven players behind him.</p><span class=quote-credit>Daniel James' former PE teacher Matt Simpson</span><p>Simpson, 45, said: “I first heard of Danny because some of the dads were talking about him at a young age.</p><p>“There’s a place called the Bull Field where the kids play and Daniel, who was six at the time, was running rings around teenagers. He was already the talk of the town.”</p><p>James was signed by Hull City aged nine and trained three times a week while representing Wales at youth level.</p><p>Simpson, 45, said: “We played a local school at home once after Daniel had been away with Wales U14s for a full week of training camp.</p><p>“He was obviously quite tired so he started on the bench. It was 0-0 at half-time and Danny came on. He picked up the ball on his so-called weaker foot and pings it top corner from about 30 yards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000496044415.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000464521650-2.jpg><p>“Even some of the away team started clapping, it was that good. It was unbelievable.</p><p>“At the restart, we got the ball back quickly and gave it to Danny. He goes down the right wing, round three or four players, round the keeper and taps in for 2-0. We rested him straight away.”</p><p>With so much time committed to football, his school would regularly send homework to James’ house.</p><p>Simpson said: “It would always be completed and returned on time.</p><p>“His feet have always been grounded. He’s been brought up well and that shows with his academic focus.</p><p>“We’ve had some kids who go into their GCSEs and not written a word because they thought their future was plated in gold with a professional contract. Danny didn’t do that, he was a grafter.”<br></p><h3>WHIZZ-KID</h3><p>This is shown in his GCSE grades: A in PE, two Bs (business studies and double science) and five Cs.</p><p>Simpson said: “Daniel’s character has obviously come through the family, his mum and dad, Elaine and Kev, and his older brother and sister.</p><p>“They are just a lovely family. That’s why it was so hard getting your head around the fact that Kev, his dad, has passed away.”</p><p>James’ father, Kevan, died suddenly last month aged 60 which saw the move to United delayed.</p><p>Simpson added: “It was horrible timing because his eldest sister, Hannah, is due to be getting married this summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000494850642-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000494850637-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000495761471-e1559920412144.jpg><p>“He was signing for one of the world’s biggest clubs and his dad passing like that is horrendous. They are a fantastic family.”</p><p>Kevan followed James’ career intently and they would occasionally play cricket together for South Cave Cricket Club.</p><p>James was in the junior ranks from the age of 12 to 16 before his move to Swansea brought an end to his cricketing career.</p><p>Coach Clive Bailey recalled one particular game James played in, aged 14, when South Cave were being thumped.</p><p>“There was one lad who was hitting 4s and 6s as if it was nothing to him,” Bailey, 63, said.<br></p><h2>YORKSHIRE YORKER</h2><p>“I remember saying to Daniel that we needed someone out there on the boundary who can catch. I sent him out to the midwicket boundary and said, ‘That whole area is yours, Daniel. Anything that goes out there, you take control’.</p><p>“Eventually, this kid skied one off the top of the bat. Daniel started running and he’s always been a whippet-like runner but I thought he’s never going to catch that, doesn’t matter how fast he runs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000512817444.jpg><p>“But he got there and took the catch literally six inches off the ground after diving forward. I have to say it was the best catch I’ve ever seen in my cricketing career, let alone from a 14-year-old.”</p><p>Such talent could have seen James end up at the other Old Trafford.</p><p>Bailey added: “Had Daniel taken a different path, I think he would have been a very good club player and quite possibly make county. We’ll never know now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX25%2FdYGYcG1opZGjerbAw2abmqaZmrlutsCmnKxlk6e2pLfErWSsr5GjwKatjJyfnqSjmq5w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
