Digital footprints and cameras are everywhere.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The post continued: “It's not hard to find evidence for corruption. It's not easy to get away with it.” Just for good measure it added a hashtag that referenced overcoming temptation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Some 1,700 people liked the post, with 200 people commenting, although the most popular comment took the anti-corruption group to task for playing off someone else’s misery.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Please stop the piggybacking!” one Facebook user named Lau Tie-tie commented. “There are a lot of ways for promotion.

It showed an old building in need of repair, saying: “I’m rotten”, a reference to Hui’s tearful apology. It was accompanied with a hashtag quoting Hui, who said at the press conference: “I feel I am very disgusting.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not everyone who liked the post find it appealing, with some telling the department to “do your job first”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, environmental minister Wong Kam-sing used his Facebook page to promote the recycling of glass bottles, and included a subtle reference to the scandal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Keep your mind on glass bottle recycling … and there’s a video to broadcast at 7pm,” the post read, making reference to the names of Hui and Wong, and Hui’s 7pm press conference.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2019/04/18/ccfbd2bc-60bb-11e9-b745-17e2afcf325c_972x_092241.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">KMB’s post urged passengers not to “cheat” in a vehicle, by eating and drinking quietly. Eating and drinking is not allowed on public transport in the city. The post was accompanied by a drawing of two mice, one with a cap and the other wearing a black mask, imitating how Hui and Wong look in the video.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">If the privacy issue is not mentioned, the incident itself, which is inappropriate, will be portrayed as appropriate.

He added even if government departments and companies wanted to use the incident for self-promotion, they should also mention the privacy concerns involved.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“If the privacy issue is not mentioned, the incident itself, which is inappropriate, will be portrayed as appropriate.
