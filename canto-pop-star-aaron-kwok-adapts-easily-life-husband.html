My life has changed a lot. Before having a child, I would hang out with friends very often. Now I have to take the responsibility of being a father, which is taking good care of his family. No matter how busy I am, I go home right after work to take care of them and spend time with them. I’m very happy to do that."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s directed by Philip Yung Tsz-kwong and filmed with the same production crew of Port of Call. Filming started about six weeks ago. There’s one or two months to go. It’s an epic story about corruption in Hong Kong. I play a role [of someone] from his thirties [through] to his seventies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">This exhibition showcases a collection of iconic Longines timepieces. Which one is your favourite?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Flagship collection. I remember, when I was a kid holding my father’s hand, he was wearing a Longines Flagship watch. This exhibition also reminded me my visit to their museum in Saint-lmier, in which you can see all these rare watches. To me, they are pieces of art.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn3.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2017/10/27/3f711fc0-b9f9-11e7-affb-32c8d8b6484e_1320x770_100932.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">How long have you been a watch collector? How many have you collected?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I started collecting watches 12 years ago when I first worked with Longines. I’ve collected more than 30 watches, and they are all Longines. Every watch has its own uniqueness. When you collect a watch, you will see that every piece of them is an artwork and has [a] different style. Once in a while, I take them out, wipe them clean and appreciate them. They evoke a lot of memories, marking different stages and changes in your life.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Every year, Longines send me a watch as my birthday gift and treat me like family. This year, they sent me a pair of watches engraved with [“AMC” which represents the initial of] me, my wife and my daughter’s English names. It’s so special. I hope when my daughter grows older, I will pass this legacy on to her. It’s something very personal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZMC1xcueZqmdn6W5pnnEr5ynrKNkrrPAyJyjnmdiZn54fZNvZpyZnqm8brzOqWSsrJGneqKt0ailZqOnpLhurcOap62rXZqutLXLsmSloZaaeqnB0puYp5w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
