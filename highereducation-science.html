The cama is now over two years old and has longer legs than a llama but no camel's hump. The idea was that a cama might become a form of desert mule with the carrying abilities of the camel but minus its reluctance to do human bidding."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The idea was that a cama might become a form of desert mule with the carrying abilities of the camel but minus its reluctance to do human bidding.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Unfortunately, the cama appears just as ratty under pressure as the camel and lacks the llama's softer fur. It charges people and bites them and refuses to stand still.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"He doesn't have a social association with anything," said Ahsan al-Haq, the Dubai royal family vet who has worked on the project .</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"If you have a companion, you are calmer and more happy. That might be the reason he is nasty."</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>There are hopes that a female cama, Kamilah, born in February, will be able to relate to Rama, although, like another hybrid, the mule, they are likely to be sterile.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The British scientist, Dr Julian "Lulu" Skidmore, who helped develop the cama for the Dubai camel reproduction centre said the cross-breeding is not as outlandish as, say, mating an elephant and a giraffe, as the camel and llama were part of the same species millions of years ago.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"In theory, you end up with an animal that is halfway in height between the two with a good winter coat," Dr Skidmore told the Los Angeles Times. Whether the cama will ever become as famous as the mule is another matter.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>"We'll produce a few then obviously we'll probably say 'that's enough'," Dr Skidmore said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK%2Bfp7mle5FpZ2tnmqq5cH2UaJ%2Bin5iav6aw1JyYraGfo3u0r8iepZyd</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
