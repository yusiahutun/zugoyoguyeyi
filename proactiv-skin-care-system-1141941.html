Now you’ve got my attention.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anua-heartleaf-toner-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/beauty-of-joseon-fi.jpg><p>Over the years, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">proactiv</a> has honed their classic 3-step skin care system to address the needs of different kinds of skin. Their clinically-proven ingredients are tested by dermatologists and the systems are specifically designed to let&nbsp;you fully embrace your inner Goldilocks. Each one is expertly developed to both clear and prevent breakouts</p><h2>If you don’t have one particular skin concern</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/proactiv-solution.jpg><p>Proactiv created the concept of a 3-step skin care system with their OG <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Proactiv Solution</a>. This acne-fighting trio is popular for a reason: because it works. And better yet? This system is the brand’s most universal—aka, a great place to start no matter your skin type.</p><p>The Renewing Cleanser, Revitalizing Toner, and Repairing Treatment work together to provide a one-two punch that clears existing acne and prevents future breakouts. In the first step, the brand’s proprietary, prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide works to kill acne-causing bacteria, without causing some of the irritation, dryness, or stinging that can come from other formulations. The alcohol-free Revitalizing Toner does something truly refreshing—it smoothes and softens your skin without drying it out. And in the third step, you get a light, oil-free moisturizer with more of the brand’s signature, proprietary benzoyl peroxide.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$19.95/month</span></p><h2>If you want an advanced formula</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/proactivmd.jpg><p>Do a simple internet search on acne-fighting ingredients and you’re sure to stumble upon retinoids. Once only available via prescription, the vitamin A-derivatives (like adapalene) are bonafide darlings of the skin care industry — and for good reason. The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ProactivMD</a> system is completely free of benzoyl peroxide and instead includes a prescription-strength 0.1% adapalene gel treatment as the third step—a major differentiator from the brand’s two other skin care systems—that attacks acne at a cellular level.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ProactivMD</a> system begins with a Deep Cleansing Face Wash that gently exfoliates as it lifts debris from your pores. Next is the Daily Oil Control Moisturizer with SPF 30, which has a three-in-one formula that hydrates, controls shine, and provides UVA/UVB protection while leaving a matte finish (SPF protection is vitally important for routines with retinoids since the ingredients could make your skin more photosensitive). And finally the Adapalene Gel 0.1%, where you get the benefits of proactiv’s prescription-strength retinoid without the extra trip to your dermatologist. Stubborn breakouts and inflammation from acne won’t stand a chance with this skin care system.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$24.95/month</span></p><h2>If your skin craves hydration above all else</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/proactiv.jpg><p>If you’ve got sensitive skin that thrives with an extra dose of hydration, then it’s time to start a long-term relationship with the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Proactiv+</a> system. Like the other two systems, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Proactiv+</a> will clear and prevent breakouts, while hydrating, brightening, promoting an evening skin tone. And while this line — like all of the proactiv lines — is designed for all skin types, it’s especially beneficial for normal, dry, and/or dull skin.</p><p>It all starts with the Skin Smoothing Exfoliator, where the combination of prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide and glycolic acid gently exfoliate to renew the skin’s surface and wash away pore-clogging impurities. In the second step, the Pore Targeting Treatment’s exclusive formula includes benzoyl peroxide patented with Smart Target® technology that stays inside pores longer for lasting effectiveness. And you’ll finish the routine with the Complexion Perfecting Hydrator, a nutrient-rich moisturizer with a low dose of salicylic acid to keep pores clean while simultaneously hydrating and nourishing the skin. The result? Smooth, bright, radiant skin thanks to a gentle-yet-effective skin care system.</p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$29.95/month</span></p><p>This article was created by STYLECASTER for <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">proactiv</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZ6Yra2imnyxvs6amq2hpmLArLXNZpqaqpViwLq%2F056kZmlhaX56gJBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
