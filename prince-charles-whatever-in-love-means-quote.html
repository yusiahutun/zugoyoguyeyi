Absolutely." Charles, however, answers, "Whatever 'in love' means." Awkward silence ensues.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Prince of Wales did say that exact comment in his real-life interview with Lady Diana in 1981, though the conversation flowed differently. When asked if they were in love, Diana said, "Of course," and Charles said, "Whatever 'in love' means." Diana laughed it off, while Charles added that the phrase "in love" is open to "your own interpretation."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When the interviewer continued that the couple looked like "two very happy people," Charles said yes and Diana replied, "As you can see." The full exchange takes place toward the end of the video below.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although the princess giggled at her fiancé's answer at the time, she later revealed in an interview that Charles's response "traumatized" her.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Charles turned around and said, ‘Whatever in love means,’ and that threw me completely,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.today.com/news/princess-diana-candidly-discusses-marriage-charles-controversial-documentary-t114764 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="she said in a personal recording" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">she said in a personal recording</a> with her voice coach, which was included in the 2017 documentary <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.netflix.com/watch/80221317 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Diana: In Her Own Words" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Diana: In Her Own Words</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I thought, ‘What a strange question — uh, answer.’ God, absolutely traumatized me,” the princess added.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Aside from Charles's quip, there were other factors that made the interview uncomfortable to watch. He did most of the talking, and there was also some discussion about whether Diana making "a very good housewife," according to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/whatever-in-love-means-why-prince-charles-and-dianas-relationship-was-always-doomed-5sj9wcdgx data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Times" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Times</a>.</p><img alt="the crown s4 picture shows princess diana emma corrin and prince charles josh o connor" title="The Crown S4" width=2000 height=2998 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-the-crown-s4-engagement-1605311319.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Des Willie</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span><p>Emma Corrin and Josh O’Connor recreate Princess Diana and Prince Charles’s engagement portrait.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bedell Smith, who wrote the royal biography Prince Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life, had a different interpretation on the princes's befuddling comment. “It was a totally inappropriate thing for him to say, but understandable given the way his mind worked and the kind of things he had said in prior years," she told <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://people.com/royals/watch-the-awkward-moment-prince-charles-said-whatever-in-love-means-when-asked-if-he-loved-diana/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=People class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">People</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to Smith, Charles very philosophical at the time, and often ruminated on things aloud. "You should look at those words in the context of the series of interviews he gave in the 1970s about what he wanted in a wife and what being in love was all about,” she added. “He can over-think things and was thinking out loud. I don’t see it as a cynical, cruel statement."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Five months after announcing their engagement, Charles and Diana tied the knot at Westminster Abbey. They announced their separation in December 1992, then formally divorced in August 1996.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
