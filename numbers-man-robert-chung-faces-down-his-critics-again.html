Lee even proposed setting up a new agency that could conduct polls to counter Chung's work.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Known for his sharp mind and pointed wit, Chung dismissed Lee's attacks, and likened himself to the child in the tale The Emperor's New Clothes, who dares to speak the truth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"But I demand something more than what the child does," Chung said in a recent interview. "The child has done it out of his intuition. For me, I report what I see based on scientific [findings]. This is the method social science uses to reach a conclusion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"The emperor will of course be kept very happy because those beside him do not tell him the truth … He is blinded from the fact that, just a few steps away, the people are unhappy about him," said Chung.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Over the weekend, some Chinese-language media accused Chung's polling of exaggerating Leung Chun-ying's unpopularity, something the pollster denied. The signs are that the row kicked off by Lee is dying down, probably because not many people - even in the pro-Beijing camp - took his views seriously.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To Chung, it was likely a case of déjà vu.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2000, he was caught up in a much bigger controversy, one that eventually forced the resignation of the university vice-chancellor at the time, Professor Cheng Yiu-chung, for interfering with academic freedom.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The "Robert Chung saga", as the episode became known, started with an article Chung contributed to the South China Morning Post in which he accused the chief executive at the time, Tung Chee-hwa, of having given him a clear message "via a special channel" that his surveys on Tung's popularity were not welcome and should stop.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The alleged interference prompted a public inquiry, which brought revelations of the inglorious role played by the chief executive's closest aide, Andrew Lo Cheung-on, in the affair, which ultimately dealt a severe blow to Tung's authority.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A long-time friend and mentor of Chung, Professor Wong Siu-lun, also resigned, and serious concerns were raised over the state of academic freedom at the university.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chung himself did not emerge unscathed from the affair, with many questioning the career academic's handling of the huge political scandal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At its outset he fuelled conspiracy theories by repeatedly refusing to identify the "special channel" which had allegedly been used by Tung to voice his displeasure. Some attacked Chung's integrity, suggesting he was part of a concerted campaign to discredit Tung.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And he pulled the Post into the controversy, telling the inquiry the newspaper had misquoted him and denying having said - as the newspaper reported - that Tung had asked him to stop conducting polls on his popularity and the government's credibility.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Post categorically denied his allegations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the 11-day inquiry was concluded, Chung expressed regret and considered himself one of the losers in the saga.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Many people were hurt because of the way the saga was handled," he said. If he could go back to the past and start again, he would not have mentioned the "special channel" in the first place, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born to a middle-class family, the son of a Chinese businessman who had spent time living in the United States, the single child never had to worry about money. But he did not show much interest in being rich either.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"I do not like money that much," he once said. "I want to be part of a group of people who do not struggle for a material life and do pursue personal interests and ideals," he later clarified.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The slim and mild-mannered academic has been an active sports player ever since his secondary education at the famous Diocesan Boys' School.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Unlike his fellow graduates from the elite school who graduated straight into successful careers, Chung took a more circuitous path. He was first admitted to the university's faculty of law in 1977, a widely sought-after course which attracted the cream of local students at the time. But he did not enjoy the course, discovering that studying law was more about case studies than social justice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He quit a year later and joined the Baptist College - now Baptist University - to study sociology, before rejoining the HKU campus in Pok Fu Lam in 1979 to study the same subject.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chung joined the Social Science Research Centre in 1987 as an assistant research officer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He has been the public opinion programme director since it was founded in 1991.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From 1993 to 1994, Chung served as a part-time community panellist of the Central Policy Unit, a key government think tank, and later became a part-time member of the unit between 1994 and 1999.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1996, he married Damaris Hung, a psychologist he had courted for more than 11 years. They have a daughter, Sheleoni, who is 16.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A long-time friend and former Post reporter, Sharon Cheung, described him as "one of the most respectable men in town". Despite being heavily criticised by the pro-Beijing camp, "he still insists on working independently and believes that data doesn't lie".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Not many people can work under such pressure without fear," Cheung said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Robert Chung</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">56</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Married, one daughter</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><br>1982: Bachelor of Social Science, University of Hong Kong<br>1987: Master of Philosophy (Sociology), University of Hong Kong<br>1999: Doctor of Philosophy, University of Hong Kong</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><br>1987: assistant research officer with the Social Sciences Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong<br>1991 - present : director, public opinion programme, University of Hong Kong</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><br>1993-94: part-time community panellist on the Central Policy Unit, an official think tank providing advice to the Hong Kong government<br>1994-99: part-time member of the Central Policy Unit<br>2006-07: elected secretary-treasurer of the World Association for Public Opinion Research</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Numbers man faces down his critics again</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuQbWxpaWZlfK%2FBzJucq6tdoq6vedGomZ6qpGKwqcHNoGSfmZOawG6wzrClZqCZqHqkvsitoJyrXZa0orXN</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
