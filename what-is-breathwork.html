In this calmer state, we are able to respond better to those situations.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Breathwork can also be beneficial for people dealing with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/beauty/mind-body/a39573864/grief-stories-television-representation/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=grief class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">grief</a>, trauma and emotional issues because certain breath techniques induce altered states of consciousness and cause an emotional release that people find both cathartic and comforting,” Eason adds.

Beyond a fad, she believes the power of breath “can help people physically, emotionally and spiritually”, whether it be using the 'Wim Hof Method', 'holotropic breathing' 'Transformational Breath', 'conscious connected breathing' or the 'Buteyko breathing technique'. “All breathwork techniques have their place, and all have their purpose, whether it be for emotional release, enhanced physical and mental performance or personal growth and healing.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">'Diaphragmatic breathing' is perhaps the best-known and simplest practice. “This is also known as 'belly breathing',” Eason says, “and is a fundamental technique that I teach in all my classes and with private clients.” Too often we breathe through our chest, she explains, but this technique involves actively engaging the diaphragm, promoting efficient breathing and wellbeing.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To try this, follow her lead: “Place one hand on your belly and one hand on your heart. Inhale deeply through the nose, feeling the belly rise and the ribs expand laterally. Focus on the belly rising first, then a natural movement in the chest. Then exhale completely out of the nose or mouth, feeling the belly deflate as the air is released. There is a natural pause between the inhale and exhale; pay attention to the movement of the breath and repeat for a few minutes.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Other popular techniques include 'box breath' – where you visualise a box and inhale, hold, and exhale the breath for equal amounts of time (such as four seconds); and the 'long exhale' – a slow, controlled breathing technique where the exhale is longer than the inhale (with no breath-holding in-between).</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-p3fpzg emevuu60">How to learn breathwork</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To learn the breathwork basics, Sandeman’s <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://hub.breathpod.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Breathpod class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Breathpod</a> business offers a five-day mini-series course via his website, where you can also access virtual events centred on breathwork.

As Eason says, “breathwork has so many benefits, however, there are certain considerations to be mindful about before attending a practice”.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For example, “emotional-release breathwork can create strong and, often, suppressed emotions to surface,” she adds. “For people who may have unresolved trauma it may feel overwhelming at the time.” Breathwork practitioners should flag any emotional and physical effects that can occur during and after a session – depending on the focus – “so ensure you do your homework beforehand,” Eason advises.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition, “certain rapid breathwork patterns can lead to hyperventilation and cause dizziness, light-headedness or muscle cramping (known as tetany),” she says. These kinds of practices should always be taught under the guidance of a certified breathwork practitioner, “who can hold space for you should this happen”. And individuals with respiratory conditions such as COPD and asthma should approach breathwork with care, “as some practices can exacerbate symptoms and should be discussed with a doctor,” Eason cautions.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In addition, certain breathwork patterns such as 'conscious connected breathing' or 'holotropic breathing', are not advised for those who are pregnant, have epilepsy, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease or severe mental health conditions. “I would always advise consulting a doctor, psychotherapist or psychiatrist before engaging in activating breathwork if you have any of these conditions.”</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhwrsSarK2xX6K2r7CMm6adsV%2BWf3d8j3BwbWhfrLWiwIyiqmaaopqutbTWqKmkZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
