He slapped her face, grabbed her by her hair, and punched and kicked her.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After kicking her repeatedly while she was on the ground, he helped her to bed and realised that she was not responsive or breathing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He then called the Singapore Civil Defence Force at about 1.35am. Mallika was pronounced dead later that night.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An autopsy found that she had died from a head injury, with several bruises on her scalp, back of her neck, face and around her body. Several of her ribs were also fractured.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During sentencing on Monday, Deputy Public Prosecutor Timotheus Koh told the court that Krishnan had asked a friend to let him sleep in his flat after the assault.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the afternoon of January 17, 2019, Krishnan surrendered himself to police.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Intermittent explosive disorder</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After his arrest, Krishnan was diagnosed with intermittent explosive disorder – a condition where there are frequent impulsive anger outbursts or aggression – which was found to have contributed to his offence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, the level of violence he inflicted on his girlfriend was “likely caused by the alcohol intoxication adding to the intermittent explosive disorder”, court documents showed.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The prosecution sought a sentence of 15-18 years’ jail, urging the court to “send a clear message that the courts do not tolerate violence of this nature”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Koh said that although Krishnan’s mental disorder was diagnosed after the offence, he had a history of “socially unacceptable behaviour” involving violence while intoxicated.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This included Krishnan’s mitigation plea in 2018 for being verbally abusive and spitting on police officers, where he acknowledged that alcohol had “severely clouded my decision at the time”.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a

that Krishnan had been referred for counselling due to domestic violence that occurred from 2015 to 2016, and that his actions showed his “propensity for abusing his domestic partners”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“No mitigating weight should be placed on whatever emotions that the accused was feeling after the deceased’s confessions to him about her relations with other men,” Koh said. “The accused is not in the position to punish the deceased for her purported infidelity.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">During mitigation, Krishnan’s lawyer said that his client had pleaded guilty early, surrendered to the police and fully cooperated during investigations.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Krishnan had been controlling his alcohol intake – drinking only on weekends when he was not working, he added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, it was Mallika’s relationships with other men that had “affected his judgment”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“He thought alcohol would assist him to cope with his feelings,” the lawyer said.</p><figure

data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Justice Valerie Thean said during sentencing that although Krishnan’s intermittent explosive disorder had contributed to his violent actions, alcohol had also been an influence.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She added that even though he was diagnosed with the disorder after the offence, “the accused knew he was susceptible to showing his temper in socially unacceptable ways” through his past brushes with the law.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Thean noted that Krishnan had promised he was a reformed individual in 2018 in his mitigation, but had continued to abuse his wife and girlfriend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Saying that she could not overlook his repeated domestic abuse against women, she sentenced him to 20 years in jail.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the maximum penalty is life imprisonment and caning, or a jail term of up to 20 years and a fine or caning.</p><p class=postsid
