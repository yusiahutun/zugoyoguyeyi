She revealed:</p><p id=eXqk0uGMd6_9 data-wc=38><strong>"Actually it was through hyperemesis that I really realised the power of the mind over the body because I really had to try everything and everything to try and help me through it.

He definitely wasn't, [laughing] I didn't even ask him about it, but it was just something I wanted to do for myself. I saw the power of it, really, the meditation and the deep breathing and things like that that they teach you in hypnobirthing when I was really sick and actually <strong>I realised that this was something that I could take control of, I suppose, during labour. It was hugely powerful</strong>."</p><h2>Prince Louis' birth</h2><p id=e0AQkmPDPtLr data-wc=39>William and Kate announced the Princess' third pregnancy on 4 September 2017.
