To help us on our way, we spoke to fashion stylists and experts, who kindly shared their recommendations and best styling tips.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-jeffrey-campbell-dagget-western-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Jeffrey Campbell Dagget Western Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="REVOLVE Jeffrey Campbell Dagget Western Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Efha0RkwdytmAIeoFPOef_oYl_4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jeffrey-Campbell-Dagget-Western-Boot-6a002e078160407e8a56cbe03743ba38.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>REVOLVE</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re cute, comfy, and versatile.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The metallic options tend to scuff easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These boots are definitely a crowd-pleaser. “My absolute favorites are the Jeffrey Campbell Dagget Boots,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Gabriela Rosales</a>, a fashion stylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">The Stylist Witch</a>. “They are uncannily comfortable and can be styled so many ways! Plus the glamour of the metallic finish is so iconic.” Stylist and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Fashivly</a> cofounder <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>Ashlyn Greer</a> totally agrees, telling us, “This metallic cowboy boot is two trends in one and sure to be the wow moment to any look. They can go with anything from casual jeans and a tee to a dressed-up mini for a night out.” (They are also really lovely in plain black or white, though, we might add.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rosales also explains that she lives part-time in the desert and that these are super practical for weathering that terrain all while looking stunning. Not just a pretty face, then! Fans of these boots concur that the Dagget is incredibly comfy and versatile, just as great for pairing with a sundress as they are with the traditional country blue jeans. While they’re overall a high-quality pair of boots, unfortunately, the metallic colorways have a tendency to scuff easily, which is a shame. Stick with the matte colors if you’re concerned about this.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>8 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: 6-11 |<strong> Material: </strong>Leather |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>3in</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-ouepiano-womens-western-cowboy-embroidered-mid-calf-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ouepiano Western Cowboy Embroidered Mid Calf Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Ouepiano Women's Western Cowboy Embroidered Mid Calf Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5fK2vDnur9POgnnvBqSqumY3lxs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ouepiano-womens-western-cowboy-embroidered-mid-calf-boots-ac86c6ba5e3149c0a33938a7d1bc34fa.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re an amazing Jeffrey Campbell dupe.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They won’t last as long as a real leather pair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you love the look of Jeffrey Campbell’s Dagget but have a smaller budget to invest in cowboy boots, Amazon carries this amazing dupe for a fraction of the price. They’re made from faux leather, which is how they’re able to keep the price down, so just be aware that they’re likely not to last as long as a real leather pair. Despite this, though, happy customers say they’re actually incredibly comfortable and are totally suitable for dancing at Stagecoach for hours on end if that’s on your agenda. That’s partly because they feature a non-slip outsole and cushioned insole for added comfort, which we love.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, these boots are so much fun and make the perfect finishing touch to any party or concert outfit you’re planning, whether you’re feeling a loud green metallic option or a pair embellished with adorable butterfly motifs. The 2-inch heel is also perfect for lending you a little extra height but without hurting your feet if you’re standing for a long time. Such a good design.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>9 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: 5-12 |<strong> Material: </strong>Faux leather |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>2in</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-isabel-marant-40mm-two-tone-leather-western-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Isabel Marant Two-Tone Leather Western Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Farfetch Isabel Marant 40mm Two-Tone Leather Western Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MnS84Txdx9tyhjoMfoxGIejs19U=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/isabel-marant-40mm-two-tone-leather-western-boots-f8d0d0a498714f9bae6f67bb50509420.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Farfetch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re very well made and thoughtfully designed.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They’re not concert-appropriate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are two main reasons to buy cowboy boots: to wear to country concerts, bars, and themed parties, or to style as a fashion statement. Well, these by Isabel Marant weren’t exactly made for having beer poured on them during an overly enthusiastic honky tonk session, since they’re —&nbsp;first of all —&nbsp;a splurgy designer item, as well as made from delicate calf leather and calf suede. “My favorite is an Isabel Marant boot, which has a higher price point and is definitely more fashionable than functional,” says personal stylist and fashion blogger <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Tara West</a>. “It looks great styled with a dress, skirt, shorts, and jeans.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Anyway, despite being delicate, these are incredibly well-made and a really sound investment. The two-toned finish, western-style stitching, pointed toe, and slanted block heel are so thoughtfully designed, and are sure to make you look both right on trend and super sleek —&nbsp;whether you’re off to work or to dinner on the town.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: EU 35-41 |<strong> Material: </strong>Calf leather, calf suede |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>1.6in</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-designer-paris-texas-dakota-suede-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Designer</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Paris Texas Dakota Suede Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Farfetch Paris Texas Dakota Suede Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/dopKWZ-U_ATPHeH_0iwFeyuJpl4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/paris-texas-dakota-suede-boots-69fddc5e582846538abd4ea86236a830.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Farfetch</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re perfect for everyday wear and styling.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We’re not sure about the heel color contrast on some of the shades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are another clear-cut fashion boot, and they’re so easy to style for pretty much any regular occasion (though, again, we would advise against taking calf suede boots to a particularly rowdy bar). They’re “the ultimate neutral boot: stylish, simple, and will work with so many outfits,” says Lightbown. “Style with denim cut-offs for that festival vibe or pair with a midi dress for a feminine feel.” The stylist loves these in the sandy off-white color, but you can also grab them in black, two shades of chocolate brown, or caramel. Meanwhile, West suggests going for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a bright metallic version</a> “if you’re looking to make a statement.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hitting at mid-calf and featuring a medium-height slanted block heel, these boots are particularly easy to wear, and can totally work as a basic in your wardrobe, since they’ll be comfortable to walk in on your commute or while meeting friends, and aren’t too loud to wear to work for example. The pointed toe also gives them a little extra flair. We’re not sure about the heel color contrast on the two chocolate shades, but if that doesn’t bother you, then these are a pretty perfect boot!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: IT 35-42 |<strong> Material: </strong>Calf suede |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>2.5in</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-comfortable-tecovas-the-annie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tecovas The Annie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=640 data-sizes=750px alt="Tecovas The Annie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NqNz8g-OKxWSlIik1hbNPD3d0Io=/fit-in/1500x640/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/TecovasTheAnnie-0dc4a1f21a8b43dba6902d57fa996a7e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Tecovas</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They have little to no break-in period.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Most people need to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“This is a classic cowboy boot from an authentic Texas brand,” says Greer. “Tecovas are hand-made from high-quality leather and are sure to stand the test of time. The mid-calf length and scalloped shape make this a super flattering style with any look.” We agree: These embroidered boots look just as cool and classic with daisy dukes, mini-skirts, and feminine dresses as they do over a good ol’ pair of jeans.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We also appreciate that these come in a great range of neutrals or neutral-adjacent tones as well as different finishes, so you can get exactly the boot you’re looking for. Plus, they’re really on the lower end of the price scale when it comes to authentic and high-quality cowboy boots. Speaking of quality, these boots garner absolute rave reviews. They’re incredibly comfortable, with little to no break-in period, and are so versatile you can totally live in them. Just note that you’ll likely need to size down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>7 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: 5-12 |<strong> Material: </strong>Goat, bovine or suede |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>2in</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-lucchese-laurelie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lucchese Laurelie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lucchese Laurelie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/8KgliC9rls8rwhgo_YPmzs5Ip1s=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lucchese-laurelie-0d03919e768b4a218cc87f4bd3eba645.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lucchese</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>It’s a traditional style made to high standards.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Some people need to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Lucchese is a legacy bootmaker founded by an Italian immigrant to San Antonio, Texas in 1883. Ever since then, Lucchese boots have remained a firm favorite among cowboys and fashion mavens alike, only growing in prestige over the intervening decades — and even debuting collabs with the likes of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Chris Stapleton</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Stephanie Quayle</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Laurelie is a pretty traditional cowboy boot, which comes in either black cowhide leather or tan floral nubuck, both with beautiful hand-stitched patterns along the quarter. While their shape is largely quite classic, they feature a 13-inch shaft for those who prefer a taller boot style, as well as a three-inch heel to lend you a little height and elongate your silhouette. Since these boots don’t come cheap, you’ll be expecting high quality from these —&nbsp;and high quality is what you’ll get: Lucchese die-hards say they’re insanely comfortable, even on first wear. Lastly, most people find the fit on these is perfect, though some had to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>2 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: 6-11 |<strong> Material: </strong>Cowhide leather or nubuck |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>3in</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-short-fp-collection-new-frontier-western-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Short</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FP Collection New Frontier Western Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Nordstrom FP Collection New Frontier Western Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DXoAbIYOf8S_Omjp8d4R5pyRr98=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fp-collection-new-frontier-western-boot-83d8e4fd5b4044669d76feae3732df5f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They go with pretty much any outfit.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> You should probably size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Free People is my go-to recommendation for cowboy boots,” says stylist and creative consultant <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Lauren Glazer</a>. “I have had these white Free People cowboy boots since 2021 and they were comfy from the get-go. I’m a sucker for a white boot as I think a pop of white is really giving to most outfits.” In fact, Glazer loved the New Frontiers so much that she also got herself a pair in brown leather. These short cowboy boots come in many other cute colors, including patent orchid pink or egg yolk yellow, and dusty blue or camel suede. So many options!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These boots aren’t just adorable; they’re also practical. “I’ve walked around town on my day-to-day appointments as a stylist in these cowboy boots,” says Glazer. “They are a very comfy boot option and I can really confirm ‘these boots are made for walking.’ With that in mind, the expert cautions you’re best off ordering these one size up, since they run small. As for how to style them, it couldn’t be simpler: They go great with cropped pants and any length of skirt, so don’t be afraid to get creative here!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>10 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: 6-11 |<strong> Material: </strong>Washed leather |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>2in</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-metallic-madden-girl-arizona-tall-western-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Metallic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Madden Girl Arizona Tall Western Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Madden Girl Arizona Tall Western Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2ojikftBbtiyGU6SoigGhbAPOLY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/madden-girl-arizona-tall-western-boots-b054d3e3f9ec442794c1323e2c734c18.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re a statement-making staple for concerts and themed parties.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They won’t be as high quality as a more carefully crafted pair.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We love a bright metallic boot, like this one, in pink or blue to wear to a country concert or themed party. With a pointy toe, a heel just high enough, and a higher shaft with a sweet stitched design, these are just so much fun and are guaranteed to make a splash. “Bringing all the Barbie vibes — these boots are ticking off all the trends!” comments Lightbown.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since if you go for these in one of the metallic shades you’re unlikely to get a ton of wear out of them (they’re not exactly suitable for work), we also really appreciate the under $100 price tag here, which comes courtesy of the faux leather. Just note that this may mean the quality isn’t as high as some of the more carefully crafted items on this list. Metallics aside, these are actually also super cute in black or white, and easier to style for a nice dinner or chill night out. Bonus points for the matching white heel on the white colorway.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>5 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: 5-11 |<strong> Material: </strong>Faux leather |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>3in</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-fringed-lane-womens-fringe-star-western-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Fringed</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lane Women’s Fringe Star Western Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Boot Barn Lane Women&amp;acirc;s Fringe Star Western Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/e35YzxRC-qv3r1CmmE7HcKrken8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lane-womens-fringe-star-western-boots-bb3ec0a6c2be46bfbb320a9a9f4e74ab.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Boot Barn</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re guaranteed to make you the life of the party.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> We wish they came in more colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, no list of the best cowboy boots would be complete without a pick from the iconic Boot Barn multi-brand retailer, but these boots from Lane are truly something. White and adorned with both silver metallic stars in the front and silver metallic fringe that looks like it’s coming down from a rainbow on the side, these are not for the faint of heart — and will absolutely make you the life of the party without even trying.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Created from genuine leather and designed with a classic snip toe and western heel, these have country music star written all over them. Plus, with the interior zip, you won’t need to pull these on and off forcefully, which is always helpful. Our only complaint is that these don’t come in more colors!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>1 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: 6.5-11 |<strong> Material: </strong>Leather |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>Not listed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-classic-frye-billy-pull-on-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Classic</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frye Pull On Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frye Billy Pull On" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/9aakkQCWGu0dXi89MRMwgRC9yvg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frye-billy-pull-on-bfdf741faad34d99b370b52e37b83282.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Frye</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re made from soft, flexible, high-quality leather.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They take quite a bit of breaking in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Another well-known brand that has the chicest cowboy boots is Frye,” says West. “When you buy a Frye boot, you know it will be comfortable, sleek, and last a lifetime.” This particular style is as classic as they come, with a shaft that comes up to mid-calf, a pointed toe, and a thick sole with hardly any heel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Available in black or cognac brown, these cowboy boots are made from soft, flexible, high-quality leather from top to toe (literally), including a sole that moves with you as you make your way to where you’re going. That also means they’re just as good for walking around the countryside as they are for a spot of line dancing. And if you’re on the market for something a little extra, you can grab a sparkly silver version from Amazon! Unfortunately, these do take a while to break in, so maybe don’t buy them the day before a big event.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>10 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: 6-11 |<strong> Material: </strong>Washed leather |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>2in</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-wide-calves-ariat-heritage-r-toe-stretchfit-western-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Wide Calves</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Ariat StretchFit Western Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Ariat Heritage R Toe StretchFit Western Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5OMuRiFZ-RdHriSDolGOyHxO4tk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Ariat-Heritage-R-Toe-StretchFit-Western-Boot-d984188322364866ae8bf48f1cf9bbd6.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They come in “medium” and “wide” widths and stretch to fit your calf.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> They can feel a bit tight around the foot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ariat is also a much-loved classic brand, but this time with more approachable price tags. “Another authentic craftsmanship brand, this red boot from Ariat is our top pick [at Fashivly],” says Greer. “The hue can read as a more interesting neutral and work with almost any look, and it's the perfect pairing for the cowboy boot's best friend this summer: a white maxi skirt.” If you prefer a more low-key look, these do also come in more traditional dark tan, distressed brown, or black deertan.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Not only do these full-grain leather boots come in “medium” or “wide” widths, but they’re also made from StretchFit material, which means they’re a breeze to put on and they fit wider calves and move with you as your body changes —&nbsp;although unfortunately they can feel a bit tight around the foot. They also feature a cushioned insole for comfort and a more durable sole that can weather many figurative storms. These fit true to size and take very little breaking in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Colors: </strong>4 | <strong>Sizes</strong>: 5.5-12 |<strong> Material: </strong>Full-grain leather |<strong> Heel Height: </strong>Not listed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-heeled-schutz-maryana-block-casual-west-atanado-prime-leather-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Heeled</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Schutz Maryana Block Casual West Atanado Prime Leather Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Revolve Schutz Maryana Block Casual West Atanado Prime Leather Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/2QezJuVjSAAvEE9mstaMAZsTuBM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/schutz-maryana-block-casual-west-atanado-prime-leather-boot-0ca8c2fd10ee4084ae5710e4b5b923d9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Revolve</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>They’re a beautifully detailed style.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> Not much at all.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We don’t need to sell you this boot —&nbsp;look at it, the thing sells itself, with its two-toned, high-shaft gorgeousness. “For those that are looking for a little more polish, this is a great option to get in on the Western trend while still staying true to your own style,” says Greer. “These boots pair great with a slip dress for a night out, and wear them with a trouser or jeans to have a two-in-one style — they'll look just like a black pointed toe-boot with longer pants.” They’re also available in a blue-jean color and a silver, but the cream and black ones are particularly special, thanks to pink and orange embellishments, and little stars around the collar.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">These are perfect for anyone looking to add a bit more height to their look, which can literally and figuratively elevate any simple look — but thanks to the block heel style, they also won’t be super painful to walk in like a stiletto heel might be. They’re also made from supple leather all over, so you’ll feel great in them all day long.

Which you go for really depends on your personal taste as well as what you’re planning to wear them for —&nbsp;a bright metallic boot is perfect for a weekend trip to Nashville, but a classic brown is easier to style. “Choose a color that suits your personal style and complements your wardrobe,” says Lightbown. “Traditional colors like brown and black are versatile and can be paired with various outfits. However, cowboy boots are available in a range of colors, including bold statement shades, so you can select something that reflects your individual taste.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Height</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Cowboy boots can go up to your ankle, your mid-calf, or your knee, and different heights tend to complement different outfits. “With short skirts, I like a shorter boot, and jeans look great with a taller boot,” says West. “If you’re on the taller side, a tall cowboy boot will look great with most things. If you’re shorter in stature, I’d choose a shorter boot, as the tall ones might make you appear smaller.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Cowboy boots are typically made from leather, but the type and quality of leather can vary,” says Lightbown. “Full-grain leather is durable and ages well, while exotic leathers like snakeskin or ostrich provide a unique more costly aesthetic. Consider the leather's quality, durability, and maintenance requirements when choosing your boots.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You can also grab a pair in faux leather if you have a smaller budget and/or if you prefer a vegan shoe. For Rosales, both leather and faux leather provide the comfort you’ll be looking for. “This gives them the perfect slouch and flexibility to easily take them on and off and like any other leather boots, they will mold themselves to your legs and feet,” she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How long does it take to break in cowboy boots?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There will probably be a bit of a break-in period for your cowboy boots unless you’ve purchased a particularly stretchy style like our pick from Ariat. “The break-in period for cowboy boots can vary depending on the individual, the boots themselves, and the materials used,” says Lightbown. “It generally takes some time for the leather to soften and mold to your feet. You can expect the boots to become more comfortable after a few weeks of regular wear.” The expert says you can wear thick socks, or wear the boots in your house at first to help speed up the process.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Should you size up in cowboy boots?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There isn’t a definitive answer to whether or not you should size up in cowboy boots, and it’s smart to read the reviews before purchasing a particular style since sizing can vary quite a bit. “When it comes to sizing cowboy boots, it is often recommended to size down rather than size up,” says Lightbown. “Cowboy boots should fit snugly around the instep and have a little room for your toes to move. Leather boots tend to stretch and mold to your feet over time, so starting with a slightly snug fit can help ensure a comfortable fit once they are broken in.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Iris Goldsztajn</a> is a Paris-born, London-based freelance writer with 10 years of experience covering fashion, beauty, wellness and lifestyle for the likes of InStyle, British Vogue, Marie Claire, Cosmopolitan, Bustle, Refinery29 and many more.
