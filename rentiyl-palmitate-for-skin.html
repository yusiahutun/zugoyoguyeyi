Also known as vitamin A, it's arguably the most famous and effective anti-aging ingredient, but it can also treat a handful of other common skin concerns including texture, dark spots, and acne.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since using <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>retinol products</a> can produce extraordinary results, dermatologists regularly recommend it, celebrities sing its praises, and beauty editors swear by it. The only problem is that retinol comes with some <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>side effects</a>, especially if you have sensitive skin. Dermatologists generally recommend easing into retinol by starting off only using a cream or serum once or twice a week until your skin builds up a tolerance. If you have extremely sensitive skin, going slow can still cause redness and peeling.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's where retinyl palmitate comes in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sometimes called vitamin A palmitate, it's the least powerful retinoid. It's a solid option for those with extremely sensitive skin who still want to experience the benefits of retinol in their skincare routines without irritation.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the fact that retinyl palmitate is mild, it can still improve the same skincare concerns a retinol would. "Retinyl palmitate boosts collagen in the skin, minimizes fine lines and wrinkles, and smooths the texture of the skin," says celebrity esthetician <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Shani Darden</a>. "Gentler retinoids like retinyl palmitate are effective and you still get the benefits, just at a slower rate."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, find out what makes retinyl palmitate such a special ingredient, why it's the best retinoid for sensitive skin, and how to use it in your skincare routine.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-retinyl-palmitate></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Retinyl Palmitate?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Typically, there are four different types of retinoids used in skincare, and all of them are vitamin A derivatives. Retinoic acid (also known as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>tretinoin</a>) is the most potent retinoid and is only available with a prescription. On the other side of the spectrum is retinyl palmitate, the weakest retinoid, which is available in over-the-counter products.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Once it's absorbed into the skin, retinyl palmitate is converted to retinoic with the help of enzymes," explains board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Mona Gohara</a>. Since this process isn't direct, it can take longer to see results when using retinyl palmitate.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-does-retinyl-palmitate-benefit-the-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Does Retinyl Palmitate Benefit the Skin?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Retinyl palmitate treats a long list of skincare concerns including fine lines, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wrinkles</a>, uneven texture, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dark spots</a>. It also boosts collagen production, the proteins responsible for keeping skin firm and smooth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It [retinyl palmitate] speeds up cell turnover for a smoother, more even texture by producing new skin cells to replace old or damaged cells," explains board-certified dermatologist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Azadeh Shirazi</a>. "It also works on deeper skin layers to stimulate collagen production and fight wrinkles."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Shirazi says you can generally start to see results with retinyl palmitate products in four to six weeks. However, it's best to state consistent in order to reap the long-term benefits</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"In general, retinoids have the best benefits when used in the long term, so it's worth it to stick with it," adds Darden.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: How to Treat Under-Eye Wrinkles, According to Skincare Experts</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-retinol-vs-retinyl-palmitate-whats-the-difference></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Retinol vs. Retinyl Palmitate: What's the Difference?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They're all retinoids, which means that they're converted to retinoic acid, the most active and effective form in the skin," Dr. Shirzi explains. The dermatologist compares retinoic acid to espresso while retinyl palmitate is green tea.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Retinol only undergoes one conversion step to become retinoic acid while retinyl palmitate undergoes three steps," she further explains. "Retinyl Palmitate is the weakest version, but also the least irritating, so it's a better option for someone who is new to using retinoids or has sensitive skin."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-do-you-use-retinyl-palmitate></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Do You Use Retinyl Palmitate?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even though retinyl palmitate is mild, it's still recommended you introduce it into your skincare routine slowly. "It's best to start with one night a week and build up slowly, adding just one additional night each week," suggests Darden. "Build up to as often as your skin can tolerate. If you're experiencing a little irritation or dryness, then back off a little from there." While some people can use retinyl palmitate every night, other people can only handle it three times a week. "It really just depends on your skin and what it can tolerate," says Darden.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As with other retinoids, it's best to include retinyl palmitate in your nighttime skincare routine. Dr. Gohara says to use a pea-sized amount of product and apply it on clean skin before your moisturizer. If you need extra hydration, follow with a hyaluronic acid serum before using moisturizer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Darden also recommends using a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>vitamin C serum</a> in the morning so your skin gets antioxidant benefits during the day. And when using any type of retinoid, it's important to wear sunscreen, since vitamin A can increase sun sensitivity.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-the-side-effects-of-retinyl-palmitate></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are the Side Effects of Retinyl Palmitate?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since retinyl palmitate is so gentle, side effects such as itching, redness, and peeling are rare but tend to be minimal if they do happen. If you have extremely sensitive skin or a condition like rosacea and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>eczema</a>, it's best to use it with caution or avoid retinyl palmitate altogether to ensure you don't experience irritation.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-best-skincare-products-with-retinyl-palmitate></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Best Skincare Products With Retinyl Palmitate</span></h2><span class=heading-toc id=toc-loral-paris-revitalift-triple-power-eye-treatment></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Eye Treatment</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On top of retinyl palmitate, this eye cream includes vitamin C and hyaluronic acid.
