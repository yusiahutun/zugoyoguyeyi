However, these days, generation z prefers TikTok as a search engine instead of Google. According to the surprising new statistics, 40% of Gen-Z users prefer Instagram and TikTok to Google as a search engine. There is more than one reason that have caused TikTok to transform into a search engine, especially for members of Gen Z, here are some of those reasons:</span></p><ul><li><b>Visual Representation</b></li><li><b></b> <b>Gen Z’s desire to consume fast</b></li><li><b></b> <b>TikTok’s unbelievable successful algorithm</b><b><br></b></li></ul><h2><strong>Visual Representation</strong></h2><p><span>TikTok is a video sharing platform. It is a social media platform with millions of videos on a variety of topics, from makeup videos to do it yourself, from venue suggestions to entertainment videos. It is very interesting for the Z generation as its content consists entirely of visual elements.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When young people want to search on a subject, the reason why they start using social media such as TikTok and Instagram instead of Google is visual sharing. For example, when a recipe is going to be searched, it is much easier and more practical to watch the video prepared in a practical way on TikTok, instead of typing it into google and reading “how to”. </span><span>Instead of reading a long and serious article in Google search, watching a video on the same topic on TikTok with current trends is more attractive to young people.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/inflownetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gen-Z-Using-TikTok-as-a-Search-Engine-1-300x200.jpg alt width=401 height=267 sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><br><b>Gen Z’s desire to consume fast</b></h2><p><span>Generation Z grew up with the Internet and technology. As a result of that, they have developed both social and visual learning skills. While it used to be necessary to go to the library and search for long hours while doing an assignment, now they can easily access information from the internet with a single click. This pushed young people to consume things quickly. Fast food, fast browsing on Instagram and a fast life in general.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Research has found that the Gen-Z attention span is only 8 seconds. Generation Z, who want to access information quickly, attaches great importance to the information being short and more to the point. Individuals can get the information they want from videos that take an average of 10 seconds on TikTok, while there are long and irrelevant information in the articles they encounter on Google.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b></b><b>TikTok’s unbelievable successful algorithm</b></h2><p><span>Another reason why Gen-Z uses TikTok as a search engine is TikTok’s successful algorithm. This algorithm of TikTok gives more inclusive and faster results for young people than Google. It is an application that records which videos you do not want to see, which ones you like and watch, or how long you watch and suggests content accordingly. TikTok, which does not show content in the area that the individual is not interested in and offers content according to the area of ​​interest, is very attractive with this feature.</span></p><p><span>Today, the power of social media has exceeded expectations. It is the place where digital advertising of brands is carried out, as well as being used to obtain information, and pass time. In social media, which is the easiest way for a product to spread information, companies’ brand channels should be lively and in line with the trends. This activity is what Gen-Z pays attention to when searching. That’s why young people use TikTok as a search engine instead of Google. Businesses must comprehend TikTok marketing if they want to stay current in this rapidly growing industry.</span></p><p><strong>What do you think about Gen- Z Using TikTok as a Search Engine?
