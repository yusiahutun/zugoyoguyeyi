Since 2013 (!!), I’ve laced up my sneakers and stepped into their infamous Red Room for an incredibly fun and sweat-inducing workout I can attest will transform your <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>physique and mental health</a>. Founded in 1998, the boutique fitness studio primarily delivers exactly what a busy (and socially active) person like myself needs: a hell of a cardio and pump session in just 50 minutes. I’ve clocked in nearly 700 Barry’s classes, so you can imagine my shoes, workout tanks, compression shorts, and fitness favorites are in need of a serious facelift. For that, I tapped 10 Barry’s instructors to dish on the very <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://stylecaster.com/fashion/shopping-guides/1617864/cargo-pants-men/>best men’s winter workout gear for 2024</a>.</p><p>But before it’s time to shop, here’s a little more about the workout: The original Barry’s class is structured around <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>high intensity internal training (HIIT)</a>, a type of exercise program the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health describes as “several rounds that alternate between several minutes of high intensity movements to significantly increase the heart rate to at least 80 percent of one’s maximum heart rate, followed by short periods of lower intensity movements.”</p><p>For 50 minutes inside the Red Room (in which you’ll want to take selfies), clients divide their time between running on the treadmill and lifting medium to heavy weights. It’s tough. It’s fun. And with the right instructor, each class honestly feels like one big party worth paying for.</p><p>Recently, the global brand introduced Barry’s RIDE, an indoor cycling and HIIT class I can’t get enough of, as well as Barry’s LIFT, a weight- and strength-based class designed for anyone not in the mood for cardio. In sum: There’s something for all athletes, regardless of fitness experience or strength level. And while the blaring music and chiseled instructors may seem intimidating at first, I promise you, 50 minutes spent exercising to the sounds of Britney Spears, Kim Petras, or Beyoncé will make it all far less scary. (To my go-to instructor, John, if you’re reading this: the people need more Lady Gaga songs!)</p><p>Beyond a fantastic workout, Barry’s instructors know how to dress well for the part. Below, 10 of the best winter workout items for men to stay warm all season long.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.6730769230769><h2>Lululemon Surge Jogger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/lulusurgejogger.webp?w=558"><p>Whether I’m squatting 400+ pounds or sprinting on a treadmill at Barry’s, I’m always choosing the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Surge Jogger from Lululemon</a>. With my workout fits, I’m always looking for two things: look and versatility (in no particular order.) The surge jogger affords me not only the ability to squat real low, but also my ass to look real good. I’m always looking for nylon and Lyrca to be added to my workout pants for stretch, flexibility, and quick drying for those intense sweat sessions.<strong>—<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Joe Nicastro</a>, Chief Instructor, Barry’s Chicago</strong></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.4135802469136><h2>Birddogs Gym Shorts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/birddogs-gym-shorts.webp?w=518"><p>Considering they just got me through the New York City Marathon, I highly recommend <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Birddogs gym shorts</a>. Through hundreds of training miles, the built-in liners kept me chafe-free and the fit is perfect. You can choose from a 6”, 7”, or 9” inseam, which is a nice touch if you want to show off your leg day, or hide your stems. In terms of style, there’s something for everyone, from the super loud resort style prints to your basic NYC black-on-black. For me, I’m always going for a pop of color. —<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>Michael Pugliese</strong></a><strong>, Chief Instructor, Barry’s NYC</strong></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.1048252911814><h2>Nike Air Jordan 1s</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/airjordannike.webp?w=536"><p>I really love and prefer to be flat-footed when I lift, and that’s where <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Nike Air Jordan 1s</a> come into play. Not only do I feel grounded under heavy weight and grip during agility moves, but they are light and look good. I like to match these with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vuori Performance Shorts</a>, which have a four-way stretch that are great for squats and also dry quickly.&nbsp;If you’re someone who likes to have compressions and security under your shorts, then I also highly recommend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nike Dri-Fit Boxers</a>. —<a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Joe Allen</strong></a><strong>, Senior Instructor, Barry’s NYC</strong></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.3892405063291><h2>HOKA Clifton 9 Sneakers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/hokaclifton9.jpg><p>I’m a big fan of HOKA’s Clifton 9. They take me everywhere I want to go, from walking the streets of NYC to sprinting a 12.5 on the tread. They provide a cushioned stride but also feel very supportive for days when I’m on my feet all day. They have every color imaginable, but the New Yorker in me is currently sporting the style in all black and white.&nbsp;<strong>—</strong><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>John Thornhill</strong></a><strong>, Instructor, Barry’s NYC</strong></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.7884615384615><h2>NOBULL Runner+ Sneakers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/nobullsneakers.jpeg><p>One of my favorite pairs of running shoes to rock in and outside the Red Room are the No Bull Runner+. These shoes are durable, comfortable, and versatile for the outdoors and the treadmill. There are tons of different styles to choose from and along with the comfort, it’s a win-win. <strong>—<a href=# rel=nofollow>Ryan O’Grady</a>, Instructor, Barry’s Boston&nbsp;</strong></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.6661870503597><h2>Patagonia Black Hole Duffel Bag 55L</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/patagoniaduffelbag.jpeg><p>As a full-time Barry’s instructor and grad student, I’m constantly on the go, and I find the Patagonia Black Hole Duffel Bag 55L is the perfect fit for my constant on-the-go lifestyle. Whether I’m going downtown to teach, heading to a cafe to study, or flying home to my parents for the holidays, my Patagonia duffel bag, which also doubles as a backpack, is perfect for whatever my commuting needs are for the day. One thing you’ll often find in my bag is a pair of the Ten Thousand Foundation Shorts—especially if it’s leg day! —<a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Josiah Manigault</strong></a><strong>, Instructor, Barry’s NYC</strong></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.3755020080321><h2>Vuori Kore Shorts</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vuorishorts.webp?w=536"><p>One of my go-to shorts for working out is the Vuori Kore Short. I’ve found the 5” inseam to be my favorite and have stocked up on nearly every colorway. The 4-way stretch and moisture-wicking fabric are ideal for both upper and lower body strength days while also a great lightweight option for cardio on the treadmill or in a Barry’s RIDE class. The liner is perfect as it’s supportive but not overly restrictive, and it also saves you time with having to do less laundry. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Vuori Strato Tech Hoodie</a> is great to throw on as an extra layer pre- or post-workout, and has softness that can’t be beat—seriously unreal. <strong>—<a href=# rel=nofollow>B</a></strong><a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>laine Johnson</strong></a><strong>, Senior Instructor, Barry’s NYC</strong></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.7661097852029><h2>Ten Thousand Recover Mock Neck</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RecoveryMockNeck_LightGrey_Front_1296x.webp?w=650"><p>As it gets cold, we know it’s all about layering up! My favorite base layer after my shirt or tank is the Ten Thousand Recover Mock Neck. It is super comfortable to just have on, it can get wet if you’re working out, and it’s also fashionable enough to wear around town. —<a href=# rel=nofollow><strong>Kenny Selmon</strong></a><strong>, Instructor, Barry’s NYC</strong></p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.616191904048><h2>Vouri Strato Tech Tank</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/vouristratotechtank.webp?w=536"><p>My favorite tank is the Strato Tech Tank from Vouri. For me, when it comes to athletic apparel I’m looking for two things: style and function. It has to look good but also perform well. This tank hugs the chest while still hanging off the body for the perfect fit, plus it’s quick drying and made with the softest fabric I’ve ever touched. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Always in Motion Boxer</a> is my go-to option during the day, lifting in the gym, sprinting on the tread, or cycling in RIDE at Barry’s.
