While these non-negotiables look a little different for everyone, the premise is the same: They should be easy to wear and versatile enough to serve as a base for a ton of different outfits. When temperatures rise, and the idea of&nbsp;actually&nbsp;wearing clothes makes you want to hide inside forever, a breezy dress is key when you have to head outdoors. That’s where linen dresses come in.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Easy and effortless, linen dresses are a delight to move in — the material doesn’t stick to your body and stands up against sweat, water, and the sun. What makes them even better is that the style options are pretty much endless. Because they’re airy and effortlessly chic, wearing a linen dress to the office feels just as right as wearing it to a backyard barbecue or out to a swanky dinner.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’ve ever tried navigating the sea of linen dresses, then you know it can be overwhelming. To help you out, I researched, reviewed, and tapped some of the industry’s top stylists to compile a list of the best linen dresses you'll want to wear all summer.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-aritzia-wilfred-only-linen-slip-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aritzia Wilfred Only Linen Slip Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aritzia Wilfred Only Linen Slip Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5sxCa-cKEccJ3WCNgfMH6OlCswk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aritzia-wilfred-only-linen-slip-dress-0b6b5b144b6d4ffb9cc00e5fd607453e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Aritzia</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While most linen pieces are intended to be oversized and flowy, this one from Aritzia’s Wilfred challenges almost every belief I had about linen dresses. First and foremost, it’s a slip dress (that needs a strapless bra, FYI, which not everyone loves), so it feels sexy without compromising that quintessential boho vibe you expect from linen. I typically look stubby in dresses that fall to the calf (I have short legs), but in this dress, I actually felt really confident. The slinky shape, complete with a V-neck and a lingerie-like silhouette, elongated my body and made me look like a million bucks.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I wore this dress (which was kindly gifted to me by the brand) out to dinner and drinks while on vacation in the Hamptons, and despite being outside in incredibly humid weather, I stayed cool and totally at ease. Even when someone bumped into me and splashed a bit of beer on my dress, I remained calm, knowing that it wouldn’t stain. According to style coach and stylist at Anthropologie,&nbsp;Leena Alsulaiman, linen is moisture-wicking and highly durable, so all you need is a light hand to wash it. And she was right. The spill dried almost instantly and didn’t discolor the fabric. When I got home, I washed it with warm water and a little bit of soap, forcing any lingering residue to come right out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>2XS-XL <strong>| Material: </strong>Organic linen <strong>| Colors: </strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-quince-european-linen-button-front-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Quince European Linen Button Front Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Quince European Linen Button Front Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/MYC4hld5n-jmiJPbK3DvHw6artY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/quince-european-linen-button-front-dress-375fcda7318a420bbbe509aff0c88c6d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Quince</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=2><p>This button-down dress, which features side pockets and a tie at the waist, is priced at just under fifty dollars.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I’ve always heard rave reviews of the brand Quince but never understood the hype until now. Created from 100 percent European linen (which, by the way, Alsulaiman says is one of the most sustainable fabrics), this button-down dress features side pockets and a tie at the waist for under fifty dollars. It’s available in five different earthy colors, so if classic white linen isn’t your thing, you have a bunch to choose from. One thing to note: Each color comes with white buttons, so if the contrast messes with your aesthetic, you may want to grab some buttons of your own and DIY them. Buttons aside, the dress drapes beautifully and cinches at the waist to give an hourglass look (which those with curves can especially appreciate) and avoid any resemblance to a potato sack.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XS-XL <strong>| Material: </strong>Linen <strong>| Colors: </strong>6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-theory-ballerina-neckline-mini-dress-in-good-linen></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Theory Ballerina Neckline Mini Dress in Good Linen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Theory Ballerina Neckline Mini Dress in Good Linen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6253z_biB51i8X4_Vfvm2WXhESQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/theory-ballerina-neckline-mini-dress-in-good-linen-fa8276423d7f41e68cbb4d5b24274713.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Theory</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list"><li><p>It's dry clean only.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Linen oftentimes looks rather casual, like a beach outfit, rather than a sophisticated piece you can easily wear to the office or a more dressy occasion. But, we found this structured dress from Theory, an expert in linen, which we think takes linen dresses to a whole new level. We love the delicate ballerina neckline that will elegantly show off your collarbones and the flirty mini style. Yes, it is a definite splurge, but with how versatile this garment is, we can imagine you'll get a lot of use out of it. It comes in a business casual black and olive green, as well as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">white</a>, which we can imagine as a great choice for a summer brunch or elevated beach party. Just be careful because it is dry clean only and might be a hassle to take care of.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>00-12 <strong>| Material: </strong>Linen, viscose, elastane <strong>| Colors: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-mini-faherty-isha-linen-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Mini</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Faherty Isha Linen Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Faherty Isha Linen Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DoaIsFu8_vIrd6o5rXIEjmZBR1g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Faherty-Isha-Linen-Dress-af6f7b507e0d4e3fa0f38c17257dc66d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Faherty</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Isha Linen Dress is Faherty’s best-selling dress, which makes sense given that I’ve seen countless women sporting this dress on the hot streets of New York City. There are a number of reasons why this one is so popular — first, it fits nicely on just about any body type. It has a pintuck bodice with mini buttons trailing down the center, plus a retro-fitted skirt that’s relaxed yet flattering. When I first put on the dress, which was gifted to me by the brand, I was so excited to discover that there are hidden side pockets — perfect for stowing keys and small items.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If there’s one thing I could change about this dress, it would be to make the skirt a&nbsp;little&nbsp;shorter. The length falls to the knee on my short legs, so if you’re petite like me, you may find yourself taking this one to a tailor. Thankfully, the flattering bodice helps keep this dress from looking frumpy, and overall, it fits well in all the right places.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XXS-XXL <strong>| Material: </strong>Linen <strong>| Colors: </strong>7</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-midi-eileen-fisher-organic-linen-square-neck-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Midi</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Eileen Fisher Organic Linen Square Neck Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Eileen Fisher Organic Linen Square Neck Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/6B1HIaQkuxRRPxq7XdkkhoISy1A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eileen-fisher-organic-linen-square-neck-dress-10e8fc44fa884db6835f400ff98237b8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Eileen Fisher&nbsp;</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Easy and elegant are two words to describe this organic linen dress. Thanks to Eileen Fisher’s iconic lightweight organic linen fabric and tiered silhouette, it’s comfortable but doesn’t miss the mark when it comes to feminine details. It’s also mindfully designed: The square neck looks modern and also hides the look of bra straps. According to InStyle’s senior commerce editor&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Chloe Anello</a>, who owns a similar version, “It’s super breezy, and the straps hit right where your bra straps are, so you don’t have to worry about your bra peeking through or dealing with the annoyance of a strapless bra.” The dress is intended to have a close fit that’s wider at the hem, as well as fit everybody with ease. But, Anello says to be sure to keep in mind that the dress runs really big and that sizing down is important to get the right fit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XXS-3X, petite sizes available <strong>| Material: </strong>Organic linen <strong>| Colors: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-maxi-reformation-marcie-linen-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Maxi</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Reformation Marcie Linen Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Reformation Marcie Linen Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HSX_bKIFx6atyik2CpG_5GuZ12g=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Reformation-Marcie-Linen-Dress-8dd10ec2b7014badb8536aa22c035a10.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Take summer dressing to the next level with this sustainably-made linen maxi dress from Reformation. The extra-breezy, unlined shape doesn't hug your body in an uncomfortable way (or at all, for that matter), looking effortless and allowing the linen material to keep you additionally cool. The low back and high side slits add a bit of sex appeal to the column-shaped dress — though, you'll need to be extra careful about what bra you wear, since the band might show in the back. (It might be a good opportunity to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>try out a backless</a> one.). We're in love with the dreamy blue and punchy yellow shades, but we also can see ourselves in the crisp white shade all summer. Dress it up with a pair of wedges and a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>chunky gold necklace</a> or keep it casual with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>sleek pair of sandals</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes:&nbsp;</strong>XS-XL <strong>| Material: </strong>Linen <strong>| Colors: </strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-button-down-everlane-the-linen-workwear-dress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Button-Down</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Linen Workwear Dress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane Linen Workwear Dress" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/qHYr2IWpf1ZfCP_Wuh_JUoluxEY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-linen-workwear-dress-c0f85f1b6e054fdfaa89c87472121deb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although the name indicates that this dress is a staple for the office (which it is), it’s also great for just about every other situation, too. The classic notched collar paired with the clean button front means business, while the relaxed short sleeves, utility front pockets, and cool, oversized fit scream ‘chill girl uniform.’ I tried the dress (courtesy of the brand) in the bright orange shade, Turmeric, and the cheery hue got me tons of compliments all day long. It’s bold, sure, but it isn’t too loud, making it the perfect piece to wear to the office and then wherever the day takes you post-happy hour.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">I got a size small but found that it was a&nbsp;little&nbsp;more oversized than I wanted. Knowing this, I recommend sizing down to get fit you won’t feel overwhelmed in. But, even if it’s a little oversized (how it’s intended to be), it regulates heat really well. This is all thanks to the material’s natural fibers, which Alsulaiman says help with body temperature regulation when worn close to the skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>XXS-XL <strong>| Material: </strong>Linen <strong>| Colors: </strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-long-sleeve-jcrew-palermo-smocked-waist-mini-dress-in-linen></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Long-Sleeve</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>J.Crew Palermo Smocked-Waist Mini Dress in Linen</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1352 data-sizes=750px alt="Palermo Smocked-Waist Mini Dress in Linen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/DB5XYdjyPkWA_jeC518AuSQ4Fj4=/fit-in/1500x1352/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Screenshot2023-05-17at3.34.27PM-e1283269df51456e90d81a80d9ed1e69.png"> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Love</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">What We Don’t Love</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Linen is typically thought of as a summery fabric, but it can actually work all year round. The Palermo Linen dress from J.Crew is particularly perfect for in-between seasons, as it has billowy long sleeves that help ease the transition from summer to fall. The dress, which comes in four colorways — blue, black, orange, and a floral pattern — sits at your natural waist, giving an hourglass appearance, and puffy sleeves that add a Renaissance vibe. As for the length, it sits just above the knee, so it’s appropriate for the office without feeling stuffy or boring. The best part of all, in my opinion, is the material. It’s breathable, moves with you, and ensures your body stays at a comfortable temperature, regardless of the season. “Since linen is temperature regulating, it keeps you warm in chilly temperatures the same way it helps you stay cool in the summer,” Alsulaiman says.&nbsp;It even comes in plus-sizes and a tall version, but any petite woman will be a bit left out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes:&nbsp;</strong>XXXS-3X <strong>| Material: </strong>Linen <strong>| Colors: </strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Care</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Linen is a fiber made from the flax plant, so it’s actually quite durable. But, as you may have known, it tends to wrinkle quite a bit. It’s also harder to clean than other fabrics, like cotton, for example, and requires a little extra care. According to laundry expert <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Patric Richardson</a>, linen is strongest when it’s wet, so you can actually pop it right in the washing machine. “Use warm water and an express cycle with a tiny bit of soap,” he explains. “Just don’t use fabric softener — it can damage the breathable fibers.” And when it comes to using a detergent, you might be better off without one. “Be careful with detergents on linen. It can coat fibers and make it harder to remove stains,” he advises. Instead, use a bar of laundry soap to spot-treat areas that need TLC. As for drying, it’s best to let your linen hang dry instead of tossing it in the dryer.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Alsulaiman, linen is exceptionally versatile for a myriad of reasons. “It’s lightweight, highly breathable, absorbent, anti-bacterial, and moisture-wicking,” she explains. “As breathable as linen is, having a dress made from the material is one of the best wardrobe staples throughout all seasons.” It’s also one of the easiest, most versatile pieces to style. Add a pair of sandals, slides, ankle boots, or even sneakers, and grab a denim jacket for cooler days, and you’re set.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Linen is typically thought of as a material that should be worn oversized, and while that can be true, it’s not always the case. “The fit will ultimately depend on the piece and what you are going for — more fitted versus flowy and oversized,” says Alsulaiman. “However, regardless of the fit, when choosing a size, I recommend a more snug fit instead of a looser one. Because of the nature of linen, it will stretch, and if you get a size that is a bit looser, odds are you’ll be unhappy when it gets even bigger.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How can you style a linen dress?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Blogger and influencer&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Lindsay Silberman</a>&nbsp;opts to pair her linen with classic, timeless pieces like&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>straw bags</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>sun hats</a>. “It’s the easy, breezy equivalent of an LBD.

Linen also responds well to steam, says Richardson. “Spraying a bottle of water on linen and following up with an iron can be especially helpful,” he adds. However, wrinkling is inevitable, so you may as well just embrace it. Silberman agrees, saying that you shouldn’t avoid linen, even if you think it’s high maintenance. “One of the best things about linen is that sometimes the wrinkled, lived-in look can totally work in your favor,” she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Caitlyn Martyn</a>&nbsp;is a commerce writer for&nbsp;InStyle, where she covers skincare, makeup, hair, and fashion.
