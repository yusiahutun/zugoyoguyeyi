On Saturday, Nov. 18, it was revealed that the 67-year-old singer had been <a href=#>hospitalized for liver and kidney failure</a> —&nbsp;and today, the star remains in critical condition in a Florida intensive care unit. “He is conscious and surrounded by family and friends, nothing is imminent and we are taking it day by day,” the actor’s longtime publicist, Jo-Ann Geffen, told <a href=#>CNN</a> in a story published on Monday, Nov. 20. The Partridge Family star’s hospitalization is sadly just the latest health battle David has recently faced.</p><p>In February, David revealed that he had been <a href=#>diagnosed with dementia</a>, a memory loss disease that runs in his family. “I was in denial, but a part of me always knew this was coming,” he told People at the time. He subsequently announced his retirement from touring as a musician. “I want to focus on what I am, who I am and how I’ve been without any distractions. I want to love. I want to enjoy life,” he said. The musician has also battled alcoholism in the past and has been arrested for DUI several times. In 2015, David lost his driver’s license for six months after being cited on charges of leaving the scene of a car accident and driving on a suspended license.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/shirley-jones-david-cassidy-0.jpg><p>David and Shirley in May 2004.</p><p>In October 2015, David’s stepmom and former The Partridge Family co-star Shirley Jones exclusively told Closer Weekly that David’s family was worried about his well-being. “We are just scared to death that we are going to wake up one morning and find out that he is dead on the floor,” she said at the time. Shirley additionally revealed David’s alcoholism caused him to isolate himself from his family, including his three half-brothers, Shaun Cassidy, Patrick Cassidy, and Ryan Cassidy. “David has not had a relationship with anyone in the family for years. We are sick over it,” Shirley told Closer in 2015.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/partridge-family.jpg><p>However, Patrick reportedly rushed to his brother’s side with David’s ex-wife Sue Shifrin and son Beau Cassidy when he was hospitalized earlier this week. “When his brother Patrick walked into the room, David lit up like a Christmas tree. There’s been total resolution within the family. They will always be there for him,” a source close to the star told <a href=#>People</a>.
