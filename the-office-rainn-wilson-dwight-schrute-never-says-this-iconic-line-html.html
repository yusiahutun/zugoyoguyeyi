Beets. Battlestar Galactica.’ is often quoted</h2><p id=par-2_20>The Office fans know and love the hilarious line “Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica” from the season 3 episode “Product Recall.”</p><p id=par-3_50>In the episode’s cold open, <a href=#>Jim Halpert, played by John Krasinski</a>, arrives to work dressed like Dwight, complete with the mustard colored shirt and glasses. Jim wears his hair parted down the middle, carries a briefcase, and sports a calculator watch — and he has his co-worker’s mannerisms down perfectly.</p><p id=par-4_21>As he sits down at his desk, Jim says, “It’s kind of blurry,” then puts on his Dwight glasses. “That’s better.”</p><p><strong>Jim:</strong> “Question. What kind of bear is best?”</p><p><strong>Dwight:</strong>&nbsp;“That’s a ridiculous question.”</p><p><strong>Jim:</strong>&nbsp;“False. Black bear.”</p><p><strong>Dwight:&nbsp;</strong>“Well that’s debatable. There are basically two schools of thought…”</p><p><strong>Jim:</strong>&nbsp;“Fact. Bears eat beets. Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.”</p><p><strong>Dwight:</strong>&nbsp;“Bears do not… What is going on? What are you doing?”</p><p id=par-5_60>In a talking head interview, Jim explains the inspiration behind him impersonating Dwight. “Last week, I was in a drug store and I saw these glasses,” he says. “Uh, four dollars. And it only cost me seven dollars to recreate the rest of the ensemble. And that’s a grand total of… [he does the math on his calculator-watch] eleven dollars.</p><p id=par-6_58>Dwight attempts to not let Jim bother him, but gets agitated. “You know what? Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, so I thank you,” he says. After Jim places a bobble-head on his desk, Dwight can’t take it. “Identity theft is not a joke, Jim! Millions of families suffer every year!,” he yells at his co-worker.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-rainn-wilson-said-his-character-never-said-the-famous-line>Rainn Wilson said his character never said the famous line</h2><p id=par-7_42>During the June 29 episode of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office Deep Dive with Brian Baumgartner</a>, Wilson discussed his character and said he often gets asked to say or sign the line. While people associate the line with him, Dwight never uttered “Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.”</p><p id=par-8_23>“People always say, ‘I want you to write Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica’ … or say it,” he explained. “Dwight actually never said that.”</p><p id=par-9_19>“In 200 episodes, Dwight never says Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica. That was Jim as Dwight saying that,” Wilson explained.</p><p id=par-10_38>Wilson said he doesn’t directly call people out on it or correct them, however. “I don’t say that, I’m not a persnickety a–hole going, ‘Dwight never said that,’ but people should realize that Dwight never actually said that.”</p><p id=par-11_11>This fact surprised Baumgartner. “Wow. I would never have gotten that.”</p><p id=par-12_9>Wilson told his former co-star, “I blew your mind.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-dwight-impersonated-jim-in-the-tag-at-the-end-of-the-show>Dwight impersonated Jim in the tag at the end of the show</h2><p id=par-13_22>During the Oct. 21, 2020 episode of the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Office Ladies</a>&nbsp;podcast, hosts Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey gave some <a href=#>behind-the-scenes scoop about the scene</a>.</p><p id=par-14_32>“I remember filming this episode and John Krasinski was so funny. We could not hold it together,” Fischer explained. “It was [writer/producer] Mike Schur who pitched the line, ‘Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.’”</p><p id=par-15_24>At the end of the episode, Dwight arrives to work dressed as Jim, but Fischer revealed that was originally part of the cold open.</p><p id=par-16_51>“I want to tell you that this was originally in the script as the alternate ending to the cold open,” Fischer shared. “Dwight had a little talking head where he said, ‘To defeat your enemy, you have to become your enemy.’ And then he showed up to work dressed as Jim.”</p><p id=par-17_16>“But in the editing process, we split it up, which I think was genius,” she added.</p><p id=par-18_27>Wilson could do a great impression of Jim Halpert, but Fischer said that, as his character Dwight, he “couldn’t be as good of a mimic as Jim.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMqJ2foZOaerOtyKelZq%2BZocCwuoydrqKfmKl6tK%2FHq6ytnV2jsrex0WaqmrGjYsGptdJmoJynnp6wbrjIp5xnoKSiuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
