Before taking a deep dive into our comprehensive <a href=# rel=noopener>blonde hair color guide</a> informed by Los Angeles based colorist (and bona fide blonde guru) <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Linet K</a>, let’s first address some of the potential reasons for why we oftentimes find ourselves leaving the salon dissatisfied (and sometimes straight-up horrified) with the end result. The most common reason for leaving the salon in a state of distress is that your expectations simply weren’t realistic and/or weren’t matched with your budget, the <a href=# rel=noopener>condition of your hair</a>, your natural color’s aptitude to lift (lighten), or the time limit you’d allotted for the service.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>If you’ve ever tried to go from a brunette (or worse, redhead) to <a href=# rel=noopener>blonde</a> with only one salon session, you’ve probably been told that this transformation is virtually impossible to undergo within one day if you plan on actually leaving with some hair left on your head. Of course, aside from consulting with your colorist about possibilities and options, it’s also possible you weren’t specific enough in communicating your hair goals&nbsp;or simply didn’t even know what you wanted (all you knew is that it wasn’t what you left with).</p><p>Even if you have the most amazing colorist in your city and bring in the most illustrative inspiration pics the margin of “error,” walking out of the salon with the exact shade, undertone and effect you dreamed of us is unlikely without the right vocabulary. &nbsp;Not only is there a highly nuanced shade palette when it comes to a vast range of different hues under the broad “<a href=# rel=noopener>blonde</a>” umbrella, but there is also a slew of different tones (ash, neutral, golden, icy…and the list goes on). There’s also a ton of different blonding techniques that will each give you a different look.</p><p>On top of this, colorists and hairstylists seem to have adopted their own language choc-full of mystifying terms and descriptives, and if you don’t know the jargon, you may be at a disadvantage when you’re trying to distinguish whether you’re coveting dimension, a smudged root, or blended babylights, or whether you’re looking for a “bronde,” <a href=# rel=noopener>baby blonde</a> or champagne-hued accent <a href=# id=auto-tag_highlights data-tag=highlights>highlights</a>. “The best thing to do is to take in photos of what you like because your interpretation or understanding of cool, neutral, and platinum are not the same or someone else’s understanding of those terms,” Linet advises.</p><p>Balayage, babylights and partial <a href=# rel=noopener>highlights</a> offer the most natural-looking blonde requiring less maintenance and offering a more forgiving grow-up process, while bleach and tones give an all-over blonde (often platinum-white) but you’ll have to be religious about <a href=# rel=noopener>root touch-ups</a> every 3-4 weeks to avoid stark lines of demarcation. “Balayage lasts for between 3-6 months, whereas highlights need a touch up every 4-6 weeks, so you can save money with a balayage with more infrequent salon visits,” she says.</p><p>According to Linet, it’s also important to factor in the condition of your hair, if you have a ton of <a href=# rel=noopener>breakage</a> from previous bleach jobs or excessive heat styling, a bleach and tone or platinum highlights, aren’t ideal. “Balayage [tend to be] the least damaging because the bleach doesn’t go all the way up to the root, and there are fewer pieces of hair bleached compared to highlights or babylights,” she says. Regardless of which technique and tone you decide, ensuring you protect the integrity of your hair (another popular salon term, I’ve heard numerous times), selecting the right products to maintain your hair’s health and keep your locks bright and brass-free is essential.</p><p>The two products she recommends to her blonde clients? A good bond-builder and violet-hued shampoo. “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Olaplex</a> will keep the hair strong and healthy! <a href=# rel=noopener>Purple shampoo</a> only once a week to keep it bright, otherwise, it will start looking grey,” she suggests.

This icy (white, cool-toned cast) is achieved by using a purple or ash-toned glaze over pre-lightened locks. As mentioned, bleach and tone blondes should expect a high-maintenance and expensive salon routine because root regrowth looks stark compared to sectional highlights, hand-painted balayage, or super blended babylights.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Color-Lux-Cleansing-Conditioner.jpg><h2>Color Lux Cleansing Conditioner</h2><p>Using a color-depositing conditioner formulated for platinum blondes will help keep your hair fresher for an extended amount of time. <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Color Lux’s Cleansing Conditioner</a> in the platinum will help counteract unwanted warmth and keep brass at bay in between your salon appointments.</p><h2 class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-title-lg data-transform data-truncate>Color Cleansing Conditioner</h2><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$9.99</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/blonde-medium-short-hairstyle.jpg><p>Butter blonde tones are universally flattering on a wide range of skin tones, and they require much less upkeep with maintaining the tone than ash, ice, platinum, and cooler-toned hues. She also appears to have what’s called a smudged root: a process that involves the colorist adding a glaze or demi-permanent gloss darker than the blonde color applied over your roots to soften any harsh lines from your highlights and to help make the grow-out look a bit more natural for those who prefer to only visit the salon for touch-ups a couple of times a year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/celeb-luxury-color-dispensing-shampoo-amazon.jpg><h2>ColorLites Color-Depositing Shampoo</h2><p>This <a data-pmc-sp-product=93bd5bbe12f90ed7bade37a29b413d2e href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"pigmented color-depositing shampoo","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Celeb Luxury Gem Lites Colorwash, Professional Semi-Permanent Hair Color Depositing Shampoo, Flawless Diamond, 8.25 Fl Oz (Pack of 1)","price":"35.00","id":"B01JQDNK80","category":"Color Conditioners"},"id":1020010,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>pigmented color-depositing shampoo</a> comes in a variety of hue-enhancing shades, including options for white platinums, golden highlights, and beige blondes.

The ash-based hue is a combination of grayish-brown and neutral blonde, infused with highlights and low-lights in a myriad of different shades and tones for an ultra-natural look that still delivers ample dimension and character. The color melt technique is a popular way to nail this look because it concentrates on lighter shades at the bottom of the hair with a gradient effect from the root to strands. It’s one of the most fuss-free hair services you can choose from, and it complements the multifaceted ‘shroom shades beautifully.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/fanola-no-yellow-shampoo.jpg><h2>Fanola No Yellow Shampoo</h2><p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, this <a data-pmc-sp-product=1fa196f025c7107fbeacf36542ecaacc href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"violet-tinged shampoo","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Fanola No Yellow Mask 33.8 oz - Anti Brass Color Depositing Purple Mask - Hair Toner for Blonde, Silver, Gray, and Highlighted Hair - Toning Mask to Remove Yellow Tones & Brassiness from Bleached Hair","price":"18.46","id":"B071JYWMXX","category":"Shampoos"},"id":1020010,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>violet-tinged shampoo</a> is the ultimate brass-blocker I’ve found.
