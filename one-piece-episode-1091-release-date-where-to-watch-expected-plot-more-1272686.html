Resultantly, Crunchyroll is the overall better option for viewing the upcoming episode.</p><p><img alt="One Piece (IMDb)" title="One Piece (IMDb)" width=1280 height=720 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2024-01/1705667535_untitled-design-2024-01-19t180056-711.jpg></p><h2 id=65aac1fc24e0a><strong>Previous episode's recap and what to expect from&nbsp;Episode 1091</strong></h2><p>In One Piece Episode 1090, the Straw Hats escape a robotic shark, but Luffy, Chopper, and Jewelry Bonney fall into the sea, unable to swim as Devil Fruit users. Jinbe rescues them, but the shark attacks him&nbsp;forcing him to retreat underwater as the perspective shifts to Marine Base G-14. At G-14, Tashigi was shown caring for the children from Punk Hazard, with some even showing signs of recovery from the gigantification experiments.&nbsp;</p><p>Vice Admiral Doll was introduced and he approached Tashigi to intervene about Helmeppo, but she declined&nbsp;as Helmeppo and fellow SWORD member Hibari were seen pleading with Prince Grus to go with them to Pirate Island to rescue Koby. However, he refused.</p><p>The group decided to wait, and their perspective shifted back to Luffy's group. Bonney was annoyed that Luffy didn't recognize her, but was surprised to learn he was a Yonko due to his appearance contrasting with his poster. She also confirmed that her crew was missing as they began to explore Egghead Island. The episode ended with a woman claiming to be Dr. Vegapunk saving the rest of the crew and their ship.</p><p>Given the&nbsp;introduction of Dr. Vegapunk in the final moments of the previous episode, One Piece Episode 1091 will likely pick up from this very scene. The Straw Hats’ reactions to this news will likely be shown, with the primary confusion being over the belief that Dr. Vegapunk is a man. This will likely segue into some sort of explanation from the woman claiming to be the famed scientist. The upcoming episode would&nbsp;also likely focus on Luffy’s group exploring Egghead Island, showing various inventions which Dr. Vegapunk came up with on the island.&nbsp;</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","One Piece Episode 1091: Release Date, Where to Watch, Expected Plot & More",1272686,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/anime/one-piece-is-nami-romantically-involved-with-luffy-1269431","articlepage","/entertainment/anime/one-piece-episode-1091-release-date-where-to-watch-expected-plot-more-1272686","Content Also read","entertainment","anime"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","One Piece Episode 1091: Release Date, Where to Watch, Expected Plot & More",1272686,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/anime/one-piece-is-nami-romantically-involved-with-luffy-1269431","articlepage","/entertainment/anime/one-piece-episode-1091-release-date-where-to-watch-expected-plot-more-1272686","One Piece: Is Nami romantically involved with Luffy?","Also_Read","entertainment","anime")'><strong>One Piece: Is Nami romantically involved with Luffy?</strong></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a7qrnEaKannV2ltqavxGacqaGjpLGmeZBpcGplopq5pq3SnmSdmaSaeri0xKucZqyfYsSiwMKhZJ6woJqwtbHDZqelp6RiurC%2BxGZoa29ia4V3</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
