Officers responding to the scene found several witnesses to the shooting. Further investigation revealed there were no injuries but a residence in the 700 block of W. Fourth Street had been struck by gunfire. An area around Fourth Street Park was temporarily shut down during the investigation.</p><p>According to the release, officers determined the shooting appeared to be started by an argument between two parties that quickly escalated into an exchange of gunfire between them. The department says this was an isolated incident and there is not believed to be any ongoing threat to the public.</p><p>One of the parties involved in the shooting, identified as Aaron Doe, age 22, was located at the scene and taken into custody on an unrelated warrant, the release says. The other party involved fled the scene before the police arrived.</p><p>The investigation into this incident is ongoing. Anyone with information about this incident should contact Sgt.
