But as an astrologer, I see a roadblock ahead. Indeed, a recent cosmological shift suggests that the bravado we’ve come to loathe and love (okay, mostly loathe) might stop working for him very soon. And as I read his chart, Trump may well be on the verge of a major reversal of fortune tied to how his stars and planets align with one of the great zodiacal transitions of our age. Here’s why:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Regulus is the brightest star in the constellation known as Leo. It has long been the most revered star in foretelling the future of leaders and nations. Known as the Great Royal Star of Persia, its prominent placement in an individual’s birth chart can predict success, authority, glory, and riches. The Great Royal Star also imposes a strict code of conduct on those whose fortunes it rules. As a result, if someone regulated by Regulus abuses the royal birthright conferred upon him—by, say, abusing his power or seeking revenge on others—he often can expect a severe, even ruinous, setback.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On August 21, 2017, a solar eclipse will occur on the exact point in the sky as the star Regulus. This brings into sharp relief the strange destiny of Donald Trump. It just so happens that Trump has Regulus on the same degree of his rising sign: 29 degrees Leo. Therefore, whatever happens to Regulus also happens to Donald Trump. This solar eclipse, will expedite events in Trumps life and may augur life-changing consequences.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bill Clinton’s destiny was also inextricably linked to Regulus. Clinton’s Sun is near 29 degrees Leo, like Trump’s rising degree and Mars. On August 21st, 1998, there was an eclipse on Regulus: 29 degrees Leo. Three months after the eclipse, Clinton’s impeachment trial began. Every 19 years, in fact, this eclipse family returns, and brings a recurrence of similar themes in the lives of those marked by Regulus. It was also 19 years ago, that Trump set up an exploratory committee for a possible presidential run on the Reform Party ticket.</p><img alt="Slope, Line, Parallel, Diagram, " title="Slope, Line, Parallel, Diagram, " width=2000 height=2773 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/star-chart-1502315576.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">.</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With this upcoming eclipse on Regulus, we can expect another year of dramatic upsets, revelations, and reversals for Trump, especially in August and the months ahead. The upheavals that Trump has experienced thus far this year are possibly a consequence of what astrologers call the eclipse’s “foreshadow.” However, the eclipse will also peel back the curtains and expose hidden truths about Trump and his Karma. Already in the weeks leading up to the eclipse, powerful people in his orbit have been stripped down and brought low. It is likely that others will face the same fate. Others who have been honorable and thus loyal to the Royal Star, may be lifted up and fulfilled within, as well as outside of the Trump administration. This will be especially dramatic for those who have a prominent Regulus in their birth charts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But whether Trump will be brought down by these hidden truths, or raised up has everything to do with who Trump really is, what he actually has done, and how he responds to the challenge of this eclipse.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at 10:54 AM, in Jamaica, Queens. His Sun is in Gemini, so he is animated by a need to deliver a message and share information. His natal Sun is in his 10th house, which naturally draws a person to fame and honors. Mars, the planet of anger and power, sits directly on his fiery and proud Leo Ascendant at 29 degrees, making him the aggressively entertaining, flamboyant, and volatile showman that he is.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Trump’s Sun, meanwhile, aligns with Uranus, the planet which spins in the opposite direction of all of the others. Astrologically, a prominent Uranus gives one a renegade, iconoclastic and unpredictable nature. Uranians, like Trump are here to break rules or tear down systems that have outlived their usefulness. No other president in our history has had such a strong Uranian signature. Trump’s public destiny has therefor been to disrupt the political and social order, and to upend the house of the establishment. This he certainly has done. In that sense, he has been the right weird man for this very weird political moment.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, it turns out he might not be the right man to build the new order that is coming. For 2,160 years, Regulus was in the masculine and proud sign of Leo—emblematic of the era of golden-clad kings, militaristic leaders and, a patriarchal world. Regulus was in Leo when Trump was born, but six years ago, during November 2011, the star moved from the kingly sign of Leo to Virgo. This transition to the earth sign of Virgo marks the waning of Leo’s masculine power and the ascendance of the feminine and service oriented leadership.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The power of Regulus in the earth sign of Virgo during the eclipse of August 21 will be augmented by the many outer planets that will soon be entering earth signs during the next 3 years. We are entering a new era where leaders are being called to serve the people with compassion. If Trump can do this, he and the rest of us can thrive—if he cannot then the power of the heavens coupled with his past and present behavior will likely bring about his public implosion.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For more from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.mypathastrology.com data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rebecca Gordon" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rebecca Gordon</a> follow her on <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.twitter.com/mypathastrology data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Twitter class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Twitter</a>/<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.instagram.com/mypathastrology data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Instagram class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Instagram</a> /<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.facebook.com/mypathastrology data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Facebook class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Facebook</a>.<br></p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/fff9dbcd-eb84-4932-8461-f287e3ccb154.jpg alt="Headshot of Rebecca Gordon" title="Headshot of Rebecca Gordon" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>As the exclusive astrologer for Harper’s Bazaar, Rebecca Gordon brings the highlights of cosmic news to you as it happens in the skies above.
