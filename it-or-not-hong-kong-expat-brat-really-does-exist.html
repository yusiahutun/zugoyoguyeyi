It was my 48th birthday, but as I sipped my early morning tea in the study, I had no idea just how overheated the day would eventually become.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A few hours later, I took a group out on an historical lecture excursion around the Pacific war sites at Shing Mun, in the hills above Tsuen Wan. Some intimation of later events portended, when several ladies immediately commented, in negative terms, on the previous day’s Post Magazine column. Then it all came out … Last week, my column explored various personality issues faced by some members of an earlier generation of expatriate children in Hong Kong, now longsince grown to adulthood. Within it, stereotypical observations were made regarding a numerically significant minority of what are often referred to as “third culture kids”. These interpretations clearly touched an extremely raw nerve, and many readers, unfortunately, took what was intended to be general social-history commentary as a very contemporary, direct personal parallel, either to themselves (as adult “expat brats”) or their children.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From Ireland and New Zealand to Thailand and the United States, responses poured in. Comments ranged from mortified outrage to full and frank agreement. The level of reaction astonished me; in over 15 years of writing historical themed columns for this newspaper, when I have regularly written about Hong Kong’s manifold contemporary problems in uncompromising terms, nothing else has ever – ever – generated such a barrage.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And I wasn’t the only one taken aback; Post Magazine editor Mark Footer wrote to me as the controversy unfurled that “… as (arguably) an ‘expat brat’ myself, I saw enough truth in your column to have been surprised at the attention it has attracted.” On Tuesday, it featured on an RTHK Radio 3 Backchat panel debate; due to prior commitments, I was unfortunately unable to attend.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Questions came thick and fast.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Was I myself an “expat brat”? No – I’m not. Did I have “expat brats” of my own that I somehow struggled to deal with? No – I don’t. And how could I possibly have any idea what I was writing about, anyway?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Well – I’ve lived in Hong Kong for nearly 30 years. Throughout that period, I have observed, close-up, enough distinct individuals to form a broad composite picture of certain definite character “types”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Stereotypes evolve because, like it or not, enough archetypes – including the classic adult “expat brat” – really do exist.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Before long, literature came to the rescue, and the whole episode swiftly reminded me of another teapot typhoon. As with Shakespeare’s The Tempest, Hong Kong bears comparison to Prospero’s Isle, an enchanted, beautiful place, but with an unmistakably dark side. King Prospero’s two retainers, Ariel and Caliban, epitomise this conundrum. Beautiful, sunnynatured Ariel embodies all that is good. Ugly, misshapen Caliban thinks he’s another Ariel until, by unhappy chance, he sees himself in a mirror. Confronted with the unflattering truth, Caliban flies into a destructive rage and lashes out at the object that reflected his ultimate self. I feel for Caliban’s looking-glass … Directly due to their early environment, “third culture kids” have unmistakable, well&nbsp;documented characteristics that continue into adulthood. Along with the negative traits exhibited by a significant minority, many aspects are overwhelmingly positive, as numerous respondents made clear.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In his poem The Two-Sided Man, Rudyard Kipling, a famously successful adult “expat brat”, summed up the cultural empathy that eventually coalesced in his creative personality. All the varied incidents – good, bad and somewhere in between – that he experienced as a “third culture kid” growing up between England and India ultimately created the person he was content to be.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I would go without shirt or shoe, Friend, tobacco or bread.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sooner than lose for a minute the two separate sides of my head.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most well-adjusted adult “third culture kids” would agree.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><u data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94314"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">‘Expat brats’ give their take on growing up in Hong Kong</strong></span></a></u></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><u data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94314"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Expat brats: the sad by-products of colonial Hong Kong society</span></a></strong></u></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">For more on Hong Kong history and heritage, go to scmp.com/topics/old-hong-kong</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOmqmtoZOhsnB9l2tqbWtkZLa1ec6rZKenpGK1sLrGZqKoppdisrm8wK1km6qRqXqzscClo7JllKSytHnEsaCsrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
