The newest point of contention is about what defines an album. Her company, 1501 Certified Entertainment, does not consider her latest collection, Something For Thee Hotties, an album. On February 18, Megan filed a complaint in Harris County District Court, seeking a determination that her CD, Something for Thee Hotties, comprised an album as stipulated in her contract.</p><h2>The label for Megan Thee Stallion has refuted the charges.</h2><p>According to the lawsuit, on January 5, more than two months after the release of Something For Thee Hotties, 1501 told the rapper that the song was not deemed an album under her contract. Megan’s contract defines an album as a release lasting more than 45 minutes. The company has subsequently refuted the charges, telling Billboard that they have the authority to choose what constitutes an album. They also claimed to have informed Megan the same thing before the publication. 1501’s lawyer said that the Savage singer published the album without the label’s permission and that he is entirely confident in the contract’s terms.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Megan-Thee-Stallion-2.jpg alt="Megan Thee Stallion" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Megan’s relationship with her label has been strained before.</h2><p>Megan Thee Stallion filed a lawsuit against her record company in August 2021, claiming they refused to let her release a song with BTS. The label then indicated that Megan would only be allowed to participate in exchange for a $100,000 payment, which Megan would not be entitled to. Previously, Megan alleged in a similar case in March 2020 that 1501 hindered the publication of her new song.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Megan-Thee-Stallion-3.jpg alt="Megan Thee Stallion" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Something For Thee Hotties was issued on October 29, 2021, as a “thank you” present to Megan’s followers by 300 Entertainment and 1501 Certified. The album debuted at number five on the US Billboard 200, becoming the singer’s fourth best-selling album. The collection includes some of Megan’s previously published YouTube freestyle and previously unheard archive tracks, with Juicy J, VickeeLo, and Dino BTW contributing skits. It also consists of the way “Thot Shit,” which was released in June of that year.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiknp%2BRo3q1tMSeZKyskaG5qrvNZp%2Baq12owqawjKGcq2WimrCwvsNmo5qalaF6coGPamScnaKptqe1xJ1knqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGK8r7GMmp6aoZ5k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
