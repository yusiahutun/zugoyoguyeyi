Sharing a photo of herself working out with a personal trainer, Blake said: "Turns out you can't lose the 61lbs you gained during pregnancy by just scrolling through Instagram and wondering why you don't look like all the bikini models.

Blake welcomed her daughter Ines in September 2016, and also has a three-year-old daughter called James.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGlpaWhlf3KBk29qbHFfmrqquNhmmaWtnql6o7jApJxmpJmrsq3FjKyrrqaenruoeceaoKurpK65pr%2BMp5ywZamkv6x5xZqqoaGfo3q4scSkZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
