But he became a regular spectator of basketball, as well as American football, while studying at the University of Michigan.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He says “love of the sport” led him to become a franchise owner. Now he is promising to channel his appreciation of the fan perspective into delivering a “great experience” at the Bulls’ home games at Hong Kong’s Southorn Stadium.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“From arena lighting to DJs to half-time entertainment, expect to see everything you can experience in the P. League, but in Wan Chai,” he said. “Suppliers in Hong Kong have the skills and knowledge, so we intend to run our home court professionally.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are also looking to go into the community, work with schools and maybe collaborate with restaurants in the district.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Steelers may have provided Chin with the know-how for running a basketball team, but he insisted playing in the NBL would be the “zero-to-one step” for the new Hong Kong-based outfit.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“It is chicken-and-egg, because you need to invest continuously, while not expecting a return in a short time,” Chin said. “You have to be prepared that it is a long-term project. We are not talking about clicking your finger.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“A professional team needs commercialisation. The end goal at some point is that it will be able to balance its books, but for now we want our team to look good. If we can bring great experiences for the fans and win their support, then we are on the right track.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Separately, it is understood that the Bulls have signed Rasheed Sulaimon as their third import player. The 29-year-old American-Nigerian guard has played across Europe, including in Turkey, France and Spain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sources with knowledge of the situation told the Post that the Bulls would probably stick with three imports for now, despite up to four being allowed this season.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/23/3cc70ff6-23d9-4cc6-a198-ee1db212f3ba_399581c5.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The league last week officially confirmed details of the new NBL season, which spans four months this summer.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The 12-team regular season will be played from July 2 to August 27, with August 19 and 20 set aside for the all-star weekend. The play-offs, featuring the top eight teams, run from September 1 to 19, and the best-of-seven finals series will be played from September 22 to October 6.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mm5mjoLK1rsClo2iZoqm2pLjEaGpramVmgHV7wpuYZqyRp7SmwIyhpqefXaC8r7OMm6ylpKNiwamx2GaqrZmiqXqurcino5qmlGKupcLEp6uuqpVisKm1zZ6qnmWelsGqu82ao2aakai4psDBmqOlZZyarqjBxA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
