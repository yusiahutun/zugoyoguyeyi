It leads to a hilarious (or infamous) scene of him struggling to maintain his composure while getting more awkward numbers.</p><p id=par-3_38>However, by My Dress-Up Darling episode 9, “A Lot Happened After I Saw That Photo,” they headed to the beach for summer break. Marin had a new suit and wanted to show it off to <a href=#>her crush, Gojo</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_26>Though she did not have a chance to show it fully. Both Gojo and fans caught a few glimpses of it under her school clothes, though.</p><p id=par-5_29>And fans wanting to see her new stylish attire got their wish when chief animation director Jun Yamazaki posted new artwork on Twitter of Marin posing in her swimsuit.</p><h2>‘My Dress-Up Darling’ animator Jun Yamazaki posted new Marin Kitagawa bikini artwork on Twitter</h2><p id=par-6_15>The new My Dress-Up Darling artwork showed off an adorable new Marin Kitagawa bikini image.</p><p id=par-7_15><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ComicBook.com</a> reported how Yamazaki would post new images of Marin to celebrate each new episode.</p><p id=par-8_44>“Yamazaki took to Twitter to highlight the fan-favorite look Marin took on with Episode 9,” ComicBook.com noted. “Although this look was only on screen for a moment (something Yamazaki hilariously admits as well), it’s been a huge hit since it showed up on screen.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3><p lang=ja dir=ltr>その着せ替え人形は恋をする 第9話<br>9話は何もやってません…！一瞬しか写らなかったけどこの水着可愛いですよね。<a href=#>#着せ恋</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/QL9LjTgfWq</a></p>— 山崎淳 ひまおう (@himaholic3) <a href=#>March 5, 2022</a></figure><p id=par-9_34>The two-piece swimsuit itself has a design inspired by Hawaiian imagery, with blue hibiscus flower designs.

While it brings My Dress-Up Darling fans back to Gojo and Marin Kitagawa, some might want a better look at the bikini.</p><p id=par-11_20>After all, an anime all about cosplay has captured the attention of cosplayers who want a look at every outfit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_34>Unfortunately, while episode 9 teased the next chapter’s title, it reveals very little about what comes next. It is uncertain if the new Marin Kitagawa bikini could appear in future My Dress-Up Darling episodes.</p><p id=par-13_42>However, you can bet on cosplayers and artists giving plenty of love and attention to the new outfit online. And with the anime’s popularity growing more and more with each chapter, you can likely look forward to plenty more artwork from Yamazaki.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6unnDq5ysq12qvW6wwKujoqaXYq6vtcyaq6iqXai1sMPSZqafnl2irrO1zWaioqyRnK64rYyboKShnp56sMHTn6CtZZ6axG6t0a1loaydoXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
