The Malibu accelerated at a high rate of speed from 4th and Myrtle Street, eastbound on 3rd Street.</p><p>The car then crossed over three lanes of traffic toward a fully uniformed Davenport Police Officer. It did not hit the first officer, and the car swerved across another lane, “attempting to hit a fully uniformed Scott County Deputy also running after a suspect. This placed both officers in fear of injury or death by being struck by the vehicle,” according to affidavits.</p><p>“A vehicle used in this manner can cause death or serious injury,” affidavits say.</p><p>&nbsp;Villarreal was stopped a short time after he was driving the vehicle. He is being held on $10,000 cash-only bond in Scott County Jail and is set for a preliminary hearing March 12 in Scott County Court.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJuarpWjvbC%2B02aboq6Vp3q1vsiem2asn2K1qsCMra6oZZ%2Bbs6qvxKuqZqSRrHqmusWoqZydnZq7tXnApaOen5WofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
