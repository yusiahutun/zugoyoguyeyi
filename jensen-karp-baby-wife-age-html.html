Additionally, the married pair didn't have a nurse at home to care for&nbsp;baby Adler.</p><p style=text-align:justify><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify><strong>Jensen Karp and Danielle Fishel with their newborn Adler Lawrence circa July 2019</strong> (Photo:- People.com)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Both the writer and his actress wife took to Instagram to share the entire debacle in details. Admittedly, they felt devastated by not being able to take Adler home.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Wife&nbsp;Pregnant With First Baby</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Back in January 2019, Jensen's wife Danielle&nbsp;announced being pregnant with a baby boy. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-609 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>Revealing the news via Instagram, the actress shared a picture of three pairs of sneakers. In the post's caption, she joked about eating for two and sleeping carelessly.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Jensen, on the other hand, retained coolness with the announcement. Using the app MakeMeBabies,&nbsp;he even shared a photo of what their future son would look. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-611 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 style=text-align:justify>Wedding Details</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The news of Jensen and Danielle expecting their first child came&nbsp;two months following their wedding.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong>More On The Event:-</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>It's official: Jensen Karp & Danielle Are Married | Found Perfect Soulmate</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p style=text-align:justify>Married on 4th of November 2018, the duo's wedding was a star-studded event. The likes of Boy Meets The World stars Ben Savage &&nbsp;Will Friedle,&nbsp;and musician Mike Shinoda were&nbsp;the notable guests at the ceremony.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Pop star John Mayer was by far the standout talent on the night as he performed his rendition of Beyonce's song "XO." On the big day, Jensen looked dapper in a blue tuxedo. Meanwhile, his bride opted to don a beautiful&nbsp;half-sleeved embroidered white-colored&nbsp;gown. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p style=text-align:justify>The wedding marked the writer's first ever marriage.&nbsp;It was his wife's&nbsp;second. Between 2013 and 2016, <a href=# rel=follow>Danielle&nbsp;was in a marital relationship with Tim Belusko</a>.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Back in March 2018,&nbsp;Jensen and his then-girlfriend Danielle solidified their romance by getting engaged.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>Net Worth, Book&nbsp;& Age</h2><p style=text-align:justify>Jensen's association with the show-biz exceeds beyond his marriage to actress Danielle. A celebrity in his own right, he is probably best known for co-writing the book Just Can't Get Enough.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p style=text-align:justify>A multi-faceted talent, Jensen dons many hats including that of a comic, an&nbsp;art dealer, a podcaster and an aspiring rapper. That said,&nbsp;the probability of his&nbsp;net worth being as high as that of his wife ($8 million)&nbsp;is very less.</p><p style=text-align:justify>What he lacks in substantial net worth, Jensen - age 39 -&nbsp;makes up for it by being the lankier&nbsp;in the relationship. He stands several inches taller than Danielle, who holds five feet and an inch (1.55 m)&nbsp;in height. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-655></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmauys63MqaypZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZqOdnqiyr3nKmqmpZZKWr7p51qKdnmWRnLJvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
