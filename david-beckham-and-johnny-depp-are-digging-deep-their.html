She cites an exhibition of large Qing-dynasty SingSong clocks that are on display at the Palace Museum in Beijing’s Forbidden City as testament to this fascination. Last year’s opening of the Gallery of Clocks in the same museum showcases the interest in clocks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is strong interest in pieces with wonderfully done enamel, diamonds, pearls and automations – movements so that you can tell right away a timepiece is more than just a watch,” he adds.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">What are the most expensive watches you can buy online?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The forefather of wearable tech, pocket watches were conceived in the 16th century, as one of the first timekeeping devices that could be owned by the public. Their predecessors were first worn as necklaces because of their size, before they were kept in pockets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The following century saw cases slim down and in the 18th century they were adorned by precious gems and jewels, which added to the price. Pocket watches were more common by the 19th century, as timekeeping became more important for trade and commerce. There have been watchmakers that share an affinity with the craft of pocket watches.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1848, Swiss brand Omega began producing pocket watches, using a traditional method that allowed the workshop to create one timepiece at a time. Omega received a start in production since its founder, Louis Brandt, opened a workshop in the hopes of producing the world’s most accurate watches. On its journey, the watchmaker created the revolutionary movement that the Brandt brand would call the 19-ligne Omega calibre in 1894. This innovation also paved the way for their wristwatch production. “[Pocket watches] are an emblem of watchmaking tradition and craftsmanship and each piece brings a little part of history to life,” an Omega official says.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There is also emotion with these pocket watches. They were owned by people who depended on their precision, whether for their social life or for work, such as [working] on the railways. So there is an important story that comes with each one, and their rarity and beauty also makes them especially popular with collectors.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/27/d16bf53a-8396-11ea-8863-2139a14b0dea_972x_100741.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Will Meghan or Kate ever get Princess Di’s Cartier watches?</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Auction house Sotheby’s reported a record US$109 million in sales of watches alone in 2019.

There are two types of pocket watches: open face and hunter case, which comes with an enclosure. Factors to consider are the age of the watch, its maker, its condition, and if it can do something beyond tell the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In inspecting the condition of an enamel pocket watch, ensure that the enamel is in reasonable condition and if it has been restored how that was achieved.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Provenance plays an important role,” Schnipper says.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">These celebs are mad for motorsports watches – should you be, too?</span></p></a></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/methode/2020/05/27/9af613e6-8396-11ea-8863-2139a14b0dea_972x_100741.JPG><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sotheby’s sold a pocket watch that former British prime minister Winston Churchill had once owned for £485,000 (HK$4.64 million) in 2015.
