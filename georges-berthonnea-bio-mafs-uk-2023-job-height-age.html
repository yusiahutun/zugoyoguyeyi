However, they didn’t make a very good impression on the viewers. Here are a few details about him that you should learn.</p><p>Here are his age, job, and height details.</p><h3><strong>Georges Berthonnea On MAFS UK 2023</strong></h3><p>Georges Bethonnea on MAFS UK 2023 was branded the “walking red flag” soon after his episode premiered.</p><p>It goes without saying that we are already enthralled with the return of MAFS UK. One of the most explosive reality TV programs currently airing, MAFS UK never fails to deliver the drama, and the current season is already living up to the expectations.</p><p>Georges’s bio reads: “Having spent most of his childhood in private school and boarding school, Georges aspires to live his life of luxury forever and wants to find a like-minded partner to be by his side. Unafraid of ruffling feathers among his fellow brides and grooms, Georges promises to be outspoken during his time in the experiment. Having been single for four years, he’s now hoping to settle down and is willing to “trust the process” of the MAFS experiment. ‘I said to the experts that I will give 120%,’ he says. ‘I trust them.’ ”</p><p>It turns out that one of the grooms had prior reality television experience, and we’re not talking about Nathaniel Valentino, a former Geordie Shore star. In 2020, Georges Berthonneau appeared on Celebs Go Dating, and at that time, he went out with none other than Chloe Sims, a TOWIE icon.</p><p>Georges and Chloe connected because they were both water signs (for the record, Chloe is a Scorpio, and Georges is a Pisces), but Chloe ended the date early because she had a little too much wine. Chlo, we’ve all been there. The date was obviously going very well until Chloe asked for the bill, which made Georges look like the astonished Pikachu meme. Georges seemed perplexed by the entire situation.</p><p>Are they still dating since he was paired with Peggy Rose on the show? Due to the way she treats males, Peggy, a technology risk partner from Kent, is known as “Picky Peggy.” The bride, who is 5’10”, says she is always at the center of any drama and characterizes herself as a secret geek.</p><h3><strong>Are Peggy Rose And Georges Berthonnea Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Peggy Rose and Georges Berthonnea’s current relationship status is unclear. However, Georges has revealed on his Facebook that he is single now.</p><p>From the beginning, Georges and Peggy’s relationship was a little bumpy, and things didn’t exactly start out well on the day of their wedding. Before having to endure a graphic account of George’s best man having an accident on the toilet, Peggy was dismayed to hear George’s best man issue a few warnings about his arrogance.</p><p>Then, after their honeymoon, the couple started fighting after Georges implied he wouldn’t mind if Peggy posted adult content online and after she learned about his gaming platform. Peggy accepted George’s apology in both cases and his poetry in which he expressed his gratitude for having her along for the experience.</p><p>Several viewers were troubled by Georges’ actions. He worried that his future wife would be a member of the alleged “itty bitty titty committee” before the big day. He continued by saying that he wanted “melons” or “mommy milkers” for his future bride. One of the first things Georges remarked to the cameras about Peggy on their wedding day was about her boobs.</p><p>Not just his groomsmen found George’s emphasis on all things boobs to be repulsive. His actions also didn’t exactly win him any admirers among the audience.</p><p>Viewers of MAFS took to Twitter to criticize the newlywed.</p><p>“George is a walking red flag, why are his boys not actually putting him in check pls??? One of my least fave grooms yet,” a viewer wrote.</p><p>“Georges is detestable!!! If he says one more crass comment about a woman, I’ll have to mute him every time he’s on TV. What an odious pig!!!! Kick him off,” one <a href=#>E4</a>&nbsp;viewer asked.</p><p>“They have done Peggy dirty… She deserves way better than Georges. A misogynistic, deluded, walking red flag,” another said.</p><p>“Feel like the sentence ‘I love women, I love fake boobs’ tells us all we need to know about Georges,” a fifth said.</p><p>The “worst best man speech ever” was delivered to Georges later in the program, in front of the audience. The 30-year-old once pooed himself while wearing speedos, Georges’ best man Cameron said to his friend’s new wife.</p><p>“Last year, we were in France in his parent’s home and we were lying by the pool. And Georges loves budgie smugglers,” Cameron explained.</p><p>“We were lying by the pool and Georges sprinted inside. And he came back outside in a different outfit,” he said. He then went on to reveal that Georges’ outfit change was due to the fact that he’d pooed himself.</p><p>All the drama points towards the assumption that Georges and Peegy weren’t able to make things work out for the better. But, we have to wait for the updates and how things turned out for them.</p><h3><strong>Georges Berthonnea Age</strong></h3><p>Georges Bethonnea is 31 years old as of 2023.
