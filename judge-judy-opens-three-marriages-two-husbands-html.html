The 74-year-old jurist-turned-television star is speaking out about her personal life in a rare interview, revealing that she divorced her first husband over his disregard for her career and got rid of her second husband when she grew tired of catering to his demands.
That second divorce was a brief one however, with Shiendlin making the decision to remarry husband number two after just one year apart."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Neither I nor anyone involved in the day-to-day production of my program has heard from him in 20 years. Not a card, not a gift, not a flower, not a congratulations, yet he has somehow received over $17,000,000 from my program.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'My rudimentary math translates that into $8,500,000 an hour for Mr. Lawrence. Not a bad payday. Now complaining about not getting enough money, that's real chutzpah!'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Lawrence called Sheindlin overpaid in his initial filing, no doubt because the larger her salary the less money he and his company would make due to the fact that they receive a percentage of only the profits.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'And in 2013, when Scheindlin [sic] was reportedly receiving $47 million annually, no one else came close, as the next highest salaries in non-scripted television were Jon Stewart ($30 million), Matt Lauer ($25 million), and Jay Leno ($20 million),' claims the court filing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'In making this deal with Scheindlin [sic], Defendants blithely ignored their contractual obligations to Rebel.

CBS had no choice but to pay me what I wanted because otherwise I could take it wherever I wanted to take it or do it myself.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And should CBS try and negotiate, Sheindlin has a response for that at the ready, not thjat she had ever needed it thus far in her career.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You have corporate stockholders to respond to. I have nobody except my grandchildren,' said Sheindlin.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'You're going to tell me you're going to close down my show because you will be making less money this year than you made last year if you double my salary or if you give me another 10 million dollars per year?
