After Jack earned an Oscar nomination for the comedy, “Pop would send Jerry a box of chocolates every year at Oscar time.”</p><p>As the movie celebrates its 60th anniversary, a new Blu-ray reveals even sweeter behind-the-scenes tidbits. After Jerry declined the role, “the money people thought Jack wasn’t a big enough star,” said Barbara Diamond, whose husband, I.A.L., co-wrote the script with director Billy Wilder. The original plan was to have <a href=#>Frank Sinatra</a> co-star with Tony Curtis and Mitzi Gaynor, but “Billy made a date with Sinatra for lunch, and Sinatra stood him up,” Barbara explained. “That pretty much took care of that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/some-like-it-hot-pic.jpg><p>Everything changed when superstar <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a> got a hold of the script and told Billy she wanted to do it. Barbara dished, “Once Billy had Marilyn and Tony, Jack was plenty big enough.”</p><p>Marilyn brought her own problems to the set, however. She was insecure, often late, and required multiple takes to get her lines right. “She was difficult, there’s no question of that,” Jack later said. Still, he insisted, “I loved working with Marilyn.”</p><p>Transforming Jack and Tony into believable women was also a challenge. Once they thought they had nailed their looks, the guys went into a women’s restroom to see if anybody noticed. “We went right to the mirror and started putting on lipstick,” Tony recalled. “I finished mine, and as we got to the exit, a girl walked by and said, ‘Hi, Tony!'”</p><p>Outsiders’ expectations for the film weren’t high while it was in production. “An awful lot of people thought it was going to be a disaster,” Jack said. “They thought Billy was trying to make a feature-length farce out of a five-minute burlesque sketch.”</p><p>When the movie was first shown to preview audiences, “nobody laughed,” Tony said. “Nobody really got it. They weren’t quite sure what it was about — they thought it was a melodrama.” But Billy cut only one 60-second scene before the film was released. The initial reviews were mixed, and the powerful Catholic Legion of Decency condemned the movie as morally objectionable for promoting homosexuality and transvestism.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/some-like-it-hot-jack-lemmon-tony-curtis.jpg><p>Despite the fact that it was banned in places like Kansas, Some Like It Hot became a major word-of-mouth hit. “Nobody paid much attention to it until all of a sudden it started to erupt,” Tony said. “The audience got it before anybody else.”</p><p>The movie snagged six Oscar nominations, including best director and best adapted screenplay, but won only one, for best costume design. “We kind of got left in the dust by Ben-Hur,” said producer Walter Mirisch. “But the Academy made it up to Billy the following year by giving him Oscars for writing, directing and producing The Apartment,” which also starred Jack.</p><p>In the years since, Some Like It Hot has cemented its reputation as “the greatest comedy of all time,” Chris said. As Walter asked, “What more could filmmakers want than the fact that a film has passed the test of time?”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For more on your favorite celebs, pick up the latest issue of Closer Weekly, on newsstands now — and be sure to <a href=#><span class=s2>sign up for our newsletter</span></a> for more exclusive news!</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46ipayhlJq%2FtHnRnq2emZxiwKav0Z6rrGWRl7y2wIyhoK1lk6S6prDYZqqopZViuaq3xGagrWWYpMFusdeco66rmauycA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
