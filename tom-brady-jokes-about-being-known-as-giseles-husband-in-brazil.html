Besides being one of the most famous stars to walk the runway as well as having a net worth of over $400 million, the Devil Wears Prada&nbsp;actress is also a doting wife and mother.</p><p>While chatting with Observer&nbsp;magazine earlier this year, the brunette beauty — who shares son <a href=#>Benjamin</a>, 10, and daughter <a href=#>Vivian</a>, 7, with Tom — opened up about the secret behind her family’s enviable bond.</p><p>“I’ve been with my husband for more than 12 years now and, as you know, men are very … They want a lot of attention,” she candidly confessed during an interview in mid-January. “They’re like, they demand … <a href=#>They need a lot of attention</a>, like children do, like your family, your friends.”</p><p>In order to have all of her husband and children’s attention, Gisele — who is also the proud stepmom of Tom’s 12-year-old son, John Moynahan, from a <a href=#>previous relationship</a> — said it’s crucial to be within reach at all times.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-kids.jpg><p>“So I think the important part is to have fully present moments with everybody,” she gushed to the outlet. “I think that leads to fulfillment, because they don’t have half of you, they have all of you in that moment and then they get recharged.”</p><p>“I’m having this experience and having an exchange,” she sweetly continued. “I’m not picking up my phone or texting somebody or thinking about my laundry or my dogs. It’s the same thing with my kids. When I’m with them, I’m with them, on the floor with them, talking with them, really listening to them. Same with my husband.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tpqZlkqeupcWMo6aknaNirqO71K1km52Zo7Rut82orqdlkah6qLXSnqOeq12dwrSuwKebZqGeYq%2Bzrdmio2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
