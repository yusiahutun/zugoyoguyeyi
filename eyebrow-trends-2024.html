Eyebrows have seen their fair share of trends. Whether it’s the blocky Anastasia Dipbrow brows of 2016 or the tweezer-happy brows of the ‘90s, the ideal brow is constantly up for debate. Like most trends, we can look towards the runway to forecast what’s going to be the next big thing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Whether it’s the blocky Anastasia Dipbrow brows of 2016 or the tweezer-happy brows of the ‘90s, the ideal brow is constantly up for debate. Like most trends, we can look towards the runway to forecast what’s going to be the next big thing. Runway shows from SS24 and FW24 have given us tons of <a href=#>2024 eyebrow trends</a> to tune into—and made us question which ones are worth trying.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to eyebrows, certain trends require more commitment than others. While you can easily take off brow gel and pencil at the end of the day, it’s not quite the same for bleached or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>tweezed brows</a>. This is why it’s important to fully back an <a href=#>eyebrow trend</a> before you commit—or at least try it out with makeup before you settle on the real deal.</p><p>The truth is, brows will always be subjective. No matter how you decide to style your brows, there will always be a more “fashionable” way to do so. Brows are an important part of the face in general, and we all have preferences on what suits us best. So while we may not want to try every eyebrow trend on for size, we can of course pick and choose what to try out for ourselves.</p><p>On 2024 runways, eyebrows are somehow all over the place—and nowhere at all. Whether it’s feathery soap brows or <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/beauty-trends/1358440/runway-beauty-trends/ rel="noreferrer noopener">barely-there pencil brows</a>, eyebrows have become a vital tool for designers to use when creating their looks. Much the same way, eyebrows can also be used as a tool to spice up looks in your everyday life.</p><p>As the runways have shown us, the eyebrows are the new window to the soul. And 2024’s biggest eyebrow trends are just waiting to be taken off the runway and into everyday life.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.762180974478><h2>Rosette Brows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rosette.png><p>Irish designer Simone Rocha has brought us the newest way to <a href=#>coquette</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">–</a><a href=#>ify</a> your eyebrows—rosette brows. Rocha is no stranger to pushing eyebrow boundaries. She also dabbled with <a href=# rel=nofollow>crystal-embellished </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eyebrows</a> when guest designing for Jean Paul Gautier in January.</p><p>Eyebrows are a canvas that fashion designers like Rocha don’t take for granted. These brows are a perfect companion to the clothing, in the same way your everyday brows are a companion to your own look.</p><p>While rosette or crystal-embellished brows are far from practical for everyday wear, they’re a great example of how brows can be transformed depending on your desired look. Editorial eyebrows are also a good way to gauge what’s trending overall—in the case of Simone Rocha, maximalist feminine touches like flowers and jewels.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=6.9678492239468><h2>Bleached Brows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bleach.png><p>Bleached brows are everywhere when it comes to runway shows. Something about icy brows is incredibly enticing to designers. This year so far, we’ve seen Holzweiler, Thom Browne, Versace, Dilara Fındıkoğlu, Tom Ford, and many others champion the bleach-blonde brow. Although their popularity on the runway has risen quickly, bleached brows are here to stay.&nbsp;</p><p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Bleached brows</a> have been a thing for a while now—with A-listers like Julia Fox and Kendall Jenner as loyal followers. Although the trend first started in the ‘90s, bleached brows become more and more common in the beauty world in recent years.</p><p>While the actual process of bleaching your brows can be quite intimidating—especially if you only want to try out the look—rest assured there are <a href=# rel=nofollow>ways to try </a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it</a><a href=# rel=nofollow> temporarily</a>. TikTokers have found several methods to get bleached brows without the commitment.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screen-Shot-2024-02-26-at-1.12.30-PM.png><p>Colorfix Multiuse Liquid Pigment</p>TikToker June used this <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Colorfix Waterproof Liquid Pigment</a> in Nude 2 to get lighter brows. She put some of the product on the back of her hand and then used a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/beauty/makeup/1101659/best-spoolie-brushes-amazon/>spoolie brush</a> to coat her eyebrows. The pigment is blendable, so you can put on as much or as little as needed to get your desired look.&nbsp;</li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=8.5><h2>Pencil Thin Brows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pencil.png><p>The age old question for brows is: thin or thick? While TikTok filters have allowed us to see what we might look like with thinner brows, it’s hard to believe that everyone will make the switch to thin brows anytime soon. Especially after the “clean girl” aesthetic brought us feathery, natural brows.&nbsp;</p><p>Citing the runway as our source, however, thin brows are becoming more prominent. Makeup artist Pat McGrath revolutionized the pencil thin brow for SS24 Maison Margiela. In coordination with McGrath’s viral porcelain doll skin, the doll look was taken even further with 1920s-esque pencil brows. To get the look, the models’ brows were first bleached and then penciled in.</p><p>Marni FW24 also took on pencil thin brows, thanks to makeup artist Yadim Carranza. The makeup look was much more minimal, drawing all the attention to the brows. In the case of this collection specifically, pencil brows were the perfect touch to a conservative yet futuristic show.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=5.7758620689655><h2>Soap Brows</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/soap.png><p>While thin brows are making a comeback, thick brows aren’t going anywhere either. Practically as popular as bleached brows, soap brows and fluffy brows have been a staple on runways this year too. With Blumarine, Prabal Gurung, and Sergio Hudson all following suit, the undone natural brow is proving its dominance both on and off the runway.&nbsp;</p><p>Soap brows are categorized by feathery brow hairs, often achieved by a brow gel or soap (hence the name). They are the definition of natural brows, extenuating your natural hairs and thickening them in appearance. If you struggle with sparse brows like me, you can still get the look with the right product.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Screen-Shot-2024-02-26-at-1.17.55-PM.png><p>Kulfi Free The Brow Gel</p>For a true soap brow look, <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Kulfi’s Free The Brow Gel</a> is perfect to tame your brow hairs while also conditioning them with serum. It gives that perfect laminated brow look that’s straight off the runways.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfmsamrtGormasopq7pb%2BMa2drbF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
