Likewise, Xiaomi, OnePlus, and LG also offer the feature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Wireless charging on Android has evolved quite a bit over the past decade. Earlier implementations were mostly proprietary to whatever manufacturer created it. Fortunately, modern Android handsets and even Apple iPhones have adopted the Qi standard for wireless charging. And in some fancier Android phones, you can enable "reverse wireless charging" to charge other devices such as smartwatches or earbuds.</p><h3 id=update-3-15-22>UPDATE: 3/15/22</h3><p>Added new phones to list for Samsung, Pixel, OnePlus, Sony, and Xiaomi.</p><h2 id=what-is-wireless-charging>What Is Wireless Charging?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/36565a93.jpg> Justin Duino / Review Geek <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But how does the tech work? Well, wireless charging uses <a href=#>electromagnetic induction</a> to charge your phone. In laymen's terms, a coil, which is typically made out of silver-plated copper or aluminum, is present in both your phone and the wireless charging pad. When you align the two coils or "place the phone on the charger," you create an electromagnetic field. Your phone generates a current from the field that's then converted into direct current (DC) energy, which is pushed to your phone's battery.</p><p>Aligning the coils is pretty straightforward. Generally speaking, you'll want to align the middle of the back of your phone with the charging pad. Similar to wired charging, you'll see your phone light up, indicating that charging has begun. Just note that you might not be able to wireless charge if you have a thicker heavy-duty case.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All of this is thanks to the Qi wireless charging standard. It's maintained by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), which defines wireless charging as "energy that is transferred from one device to another without physically plugging in a cable."</p><p>Pretty simple, right? Now time for the confusing bit: charging speeds. All wireless charging-capable phones support 5W charging. It's the standard, but it's pretty slow. Unfortunately, faster charging on Android is a mess. Most manufacturers use their own proprietary "standard" to charge faster. That's why you'll see certain wireless chargers advertise specifically for Samsung phones, for example.</p><p>Flagship Samsung phones from 2019 or later support the company's <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Fast Wireless Charging 2.0 standard</a>. Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10 owners should expect up to 12W of charging, while the Note 10+ and beyond will see up to 15W. Fortunately, 15W is "fast enough" to the point where speed doesn't matter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fae9908c.jpg> Justin Duino / Review Geek<p>If you want to talk about proprietary standards, look at the first-party wireless charger from OnePlus. The company's <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Warp Charge 30 Wireless Charger</a> will net you up to 30W of ridiculously fast wireless charging for your OnePlus 8 Pro. Unfortunately, you'll be stuck with 5W of standard charging with any other phone.</p><p>While 30W charging is insanely fast, especially wirelessly, that does come with some compromises. The biggest is how loud the charger can get. Due to the sheer speed of the charger, it has built-in fans to dissipate heat. It also has an integrated charging cable, which means you'll need to ditch the entire charger if the cable frays or breaks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And to take it a step further, you'll only get 30W charging with the OnePlus charger. No third-party wireless chargers have access to that kind of speed. But that also means unless you <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">pony up the $70</a>, you'll be looking at 5W speeds on any other charger.</p><p>And then you have reverse wireless charging, which is available in most newer&nbsp;<a href=#>Samsung</a>&nbsp;phones and <a href=#>the Google Pixels.</a>&nbsp;The name says it all, it enables you to charge accessories such as true wireless earbuds, smartwatches, and other phones by placing them in the middle of the back of your phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/d29b2187.jpg> Belkin<p>But don't expect fast charging. You can technically charge another phone with the feature and it's great in a pinch, but reverse wireless charging is limited to around 5W in terms of speed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=which-android-phones-support-wireless-charging>Which Android Phones Support Wireless Charging?</h2><p>For the most part, glass backs are an easy indicator as to whether or not a phone supports wireless charging (though it's not a guarantee). Some lower-end phones may opt to use plastic backs as a cost-saving measure. Unfortunately, wireless charging does not work through aluminum or other metals.</p><p>But just in case you're unsure, the following recent Android phones support wireless charging:</p><h3 id=samsung>Samsung</h3><ul><li>Samsung Galaxy <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S22</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S22+</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S22 Ultra</a></li><li>Samsung Galaxy <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Z Fold 3</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Z Fold 2 5G</a></li><li>Samsung Galaxy <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Z Flip</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Flip 5G</a></li><li>Samsung Galaxy <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S21 5G</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S21+ 5G</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S21 Ultra 5G</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S21 FE 5G</a></li><li>Samsung Galaxy <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Note 20 Ultra 5G</a></li><li>Samsung Galaxy <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S20 5G</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S20 Ultra 5G</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S20 FE 5GE</a></li><li>Samsung Galaxy <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Note 10</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Note 10 Plus</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Note 10 Plus 5G</a></li><li>Samsung Galaxy <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S10</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S10 Plus</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S10e</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S10 5G</a></li><li>Samsung Galaxy <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Note 9</a></li><li>Samsung Galaxy <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S9</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">S9+</a></li></ul><h3 id=google>Google</h3><ul><li>Google <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Pixel 6</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Pixel 6 Pro</a></li><li>Google <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Pixel 5</a></li><li>Google <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Pixel 4</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Pixel 4 XL</a></li><li>Google <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Pixel 3</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Pixel 3 XL</a></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=lg>LG</h3><ul><li>LG <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Velvet</a></li><li>LG <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">V60</a></li><li>LG <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">G8</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">G8X</a></li><li>LG <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">V50</a></li><li>LG <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">V40</a></li><li>LG <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">V35</a></li><li>LG <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">G7</a></li><li>LG <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">V30</a></li></ul><h3 id=the-others>The Others</h3><ul><li>Xiaomi 12, 12 Pro (will update once available)</li><li>Xiaomi <a href=#>Mi 10T Pro</a></li><li>OnePlus <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">9</a>, <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">9 Pro</a></li><li>OnePlus <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">8 Pro</a></li><li>Sony <a href=# class="norewrite noskim" rel="sponsored nofollow">Xperia 1 iii</a></li></ul><h2 id=what-are-the-downsides-to-wireless-charging>What Are the Downsides to Wireless Charging?</h2><p>Wireless charging isn't perfect. It has some issues, such as the inability to use and charge your phone simultaneously. Some chargers try to work around this by propping your phone upwards at an angle, but the problem remains: as soon as you pick up your phone, charging stops.</p><p>Alignment could be an issue as well. If you don't align the coils, your phone simply won't charge. You should also avoid wireless charging if you have a case that holds credit cards or RFID cards, as inductive charging can permanently damage the magnetic stripe on your cards; otherwise, you'd need to remove your case every time you charge the phone---a total hassle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And&nbsp;don't forget that wireless charging is generally slower than just plugging in your phone. Most Android handsets come with fast chargers in the box. Charging speeds will vary between manufacturers but generally speaking, you're looking at about 90 minutes to go from a dead battery to 100% with a 20W USB-C power adapter. In comparison, charging a phone from dead to 100% with a standard 5W wireless charger will take roughly 3 to 3.5 hours.</p><h2 id=the-best-wireless-chargers-for-your-android-phone>The Best Wireless Chargers for Your Android Phone</h2><p>Now that you know what wireless charging is, it's time to find the perfect charger for you.
