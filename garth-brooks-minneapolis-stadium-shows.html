"They were, 'Hey, there's something about this guy's music," and they were the reason other things happened for us. So there's a love affair between me and them. And it might all be from my side, but I'm enjoying myself."</p><p><strong>See the 5 Best Moments from Garth's Show at Notre Dame</strong></p><p>Brooks has announced that his next album will be titled Fun, though he has revealed few other details of the project. He says fans should have plenty to keep them happy by the end of the year.</p><p>"I think you can expect plenty of fun, and I think you can find it in a way that you haven't seen from us before," the country superstar says. "And I think you're gonna find it in a way that we have not traveled into the video world probably in about 15 years. The song that's coming up lends itself to video, and the way that it's going to be presented to you is gonna be a lot more than just Garth Brooks."</p><p>Brooks will hit the stage in Minneapolis again on Saturday night (May 4) for the second of two shows as part of a stadium tour that kicked off in March and will see him performing in 10-12 stadiums per year over the course of three years.</p><p><strong>Jimmie Allen Is a Country Original:</strong></p><p><strong>Garth Brooks Songs Ranked Worst to First:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmoJmiqbVurtGopqSrXaK2r7rEmqeopJmoerTAwJ2grqVdqLWww9Jo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
