Travis was initially tight-lipped about the relationship at first. “I said what I said. And I meant what I said when I said it.

Sicilliano pressed him for more, however. “Has she reached out?” he asked, to which Travis remained tight-lipped. “And that’s gonna wrap it up here,” he said, ending the interview.</p><p>Things started to stir up when Taylor started to attend Chiefs games. Swift celebrated with Kelce’s mom Donna in a suite at Arrowhead Stadium when Travis scored a touchdown that Kelce scored against the Chicago Bears.</p><p>“Shoutout to Taylor for pulling up,” Kelce said on his podcast&nbsp;New Heights&nbsp;which he co-hosts with his brother, Eagles center Jason Kelce. “That was pretty ballsy. I just thought it was awesome that everybody in the suite had nothing but good things to say about her, the friends, and family. She looked amazing, everybody was talking about her in great light, and on top of that the day went perfect for the Chiefs.”</p><p>Swift attended more games with her crew with Blake Lively, Sophie Turner, Brittany Mahomes, and more. The two made cameos in a September episode of Saturday Night Live where right after they were walking hand in hand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/travis-kelce-chiefs-jersey.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbsDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGafmqScpMSmsc1mmqirpKq6pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
