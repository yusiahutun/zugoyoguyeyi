Every aspect of all the performances tonight made us so proud of this scene and excited for its future."</p><p>Other award winners on the night included Bring Me The Horizon, Enter Shikari and Nova Twins.</p><p>Over 1.4 million public votes were cast to decide the winners.</p><p><b><i>For more of the latest showbiz news from Daily Star, make sure you sign up to one of our newsletters <a href=# rel=follow data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link data-content-type=section>here.</a></i></b></p><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24832814><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|Image aria-label="Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts' sweet final photograph with wife before death at 80" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24832814><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24900601.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Music-Awards-banned-for-topless-singer.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24832887.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_Charlie-Watts-final-snap-with-wife.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index2|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24832814>Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts' sweet final photograph with wife before death at 80</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><h5 class="publication-theme-icon publication-theme-border">Read More</h5><h5 class="hidden related-articles publication-theme-icon publication-font">Related Articles</h5><ul><li data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24832397><a class="embed-image hidden" href=# data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|Image aria-label="Shania Twain's wild love life as she swapped husbands with best pal after ex cheated" data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24832397><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24832887.ece/ALTERNATES/s458/0_Charlie-Watts-final-snap-with-wife.jpg></a> <a href=# data-image=https://i2-prod.dailystar.co.uk/incoming/article24832464.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_banner-shania-twain.jpg data-link-tracking=InArticle|Rec|ReadMore|index3|text data-tmdatatrack=read-more data-tmdatatrack-articleid=24832397>Shania Twain's wild love life as she swapped husbands with best pal after ex cheated</a><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/s2-prod.mirror.co.uk/@trinitymirrordigital/chameleon-branding/publications/dailystar/img/logo-schema-dailystar.png alt=dailystar style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKuYpMSjtdlopK6rmZh6p63NrGSrmZeaeqLDwKubrGWTmr%2Bmuc6nsGZqZG59cX2Xbw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
