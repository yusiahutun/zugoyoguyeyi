Although he said he had long since gotten ‘over her’ ever since she started dating Brad Pitt, he explained how it was still “devastating” to be confronted by Aniston.</p><p>“‘We can smell it,’ she said, in a kind of weird but loving way, and the plural ‘we’ hit me like a sledgehammer,” he wrote.</p><p>Speaking in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a> with Diane Sawyer, Perry said the confrontation was a “scary” moment. Although the whole cast was there for him in his time of need, he revealed it was Jennifer who checked on him the most.</p><p>“You know, I’m really grateful to her for that.”</p><p>The main cast of Friends have remained quiet on social media since the passing of their beloved Friends, however, Maggie Wheeler, who played<a href=#> Janice, posted an emotional tribute</a> to her ‘on-screen ex-boyfriend.’</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-star-almost-lost-his-life-a-few-years-prior-to-his-death>The star almost lost his life a few years prior to his death</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1487088318-1024x733.jpg><p>On the first page of his memoir, the 54-year-old wrote: “Hi, my name is Matthew, although you may know me by another name. My friends call me Matty, and I should be dead by now.”</p><p>The incident happened in 2018 when the star suffered from a burst colon due to opioid overuse. The star was given only a 2% chance of survival, he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> PEOPLE. He spent two weeks in a coma and five months in the hospital and used a colostomy bag for nine months after.</p><p>At the end of his memoir, Perry also detailed how he’d <a href=#>like to be remembered</a> after his death.</p><p>Although many will remember him as the iconic Chandler Bing, he said: “It would be nice if Friends were listed far behind the things I did to try to help other people. I know it won’t happen, but it would be nice.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2h9cK%2FOZqqtmaKoeqe71KtksKeimcBuwM5mpJqspJ2yuHnPnqmrsV2Wr7DB02afoqtdmb%2BqusqipaBlmJ7BbrjIpJxmmV2ouaawxp6fmqWdmr9w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
