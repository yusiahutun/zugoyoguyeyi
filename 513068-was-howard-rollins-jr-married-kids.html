However, the statute is at Baltimore's Great Blacks in Wax Museum.</p><h2>Was Howard Rollins Jr ever married?</h2><p class=align-left>The biggest question has always been, “Who did Howard Rollins date?” The <a href=#>television actor</a> from the United States of America never married or had children.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, don’t expect to hear anything about Howard Rollins’ son because he never got one.</p><h2>Howard Rollins dressed up as a woman</h2><p class=align-left>Many people didn’t know that Howard Rollins lived a double life. As people were busy speculating about Howard Rollins’ wife as they were trying to figure out if he was married, the professional actor was doing something else even more fascinating.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/749a7d46d40a531e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Sam Richardson's wife now? Love life and dating history</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After his death, it came out that Howard liked dressing up as a woman. His best friends and neighbours <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">revealed the secrets</a> during an interview with GLOBE on December 24, 1996.</p>His favourite thing in the world was showing off a new outfit to a friend – especially winter ensembles like a lady’s coat over a skirt and stockings. When he was feeling well, he loved to dress in a spectacular woman’s outfit and go to clubs looking for male lovers.<p class=align-left>They stated that he liked dressing up as a woman as it brought him relief. His friends and neighbours also noted that Howard dressed as Tooraloora Goldfarb and wanted people to refer to him as Tooraloora when in the attire.</p><p class=align-left>Some of Howard’s work colleagues said he would stand in front of a mirror in his gowns, fixing his fake bosoms and arranging his seams. One of his friends, Franco, stated that Howard had a collection of six wigs (four blondes, a brunette, and a redhead).</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/1866546a7088f0ef.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All about the late James Cannon Who is Nick Cannon's real father?</span></p></a><h2>Howard desired to be buried in a dress</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/49b5cf367ea4ad78.jpg><p class=align-left>Howard had requested to be buried as a woman. He had asked to be put in a black and gold beaded <a href=#>cocktail dress</a> in the casket, complete with makeup and fake eyelashes. Interestingly, Howard died a few weeks after the demands. He was unconscious in his apartment, dressed in a spangled gown and wig.</p><h2>Was Howard Rollins gay?</h2><p class=align-left>It was no secret now that Howard was secretly dressing as a woman, away from the people he knew. However, Howard never publicly stated his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sexual orientation</a> despite it coming out later that he liked dressing up as a woman. The fact that he precisely requested to be buried in a woman's clothing inclines him towards being gay, but it is not absolute.</p><h2>Howard's relationship life - Final word</h2><p class=align-left>People have always wondered, “Was Howard Rollins Jr ever married?”. The actor never married, and he didn’t leave any children behind. His only family is his siblings and parents if they are alive.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/aa61bf1528c940ba.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 famous bald black actors that you should watch in 2024</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Are you looking for more information about Steve Perry’s wife?
