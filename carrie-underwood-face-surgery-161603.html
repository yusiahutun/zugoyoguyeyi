Yet somehow, 13 years later, she looks younger than she did when we first met her! Despite suffering a nasty fall last November that left the blonde beauty with roughly 40 stitches in her face, she’s still got a fit, healthy body and stunning features that have left some fans wondering if the country darling has gotten plastic surgery. Not to mention, she looked a little too good during this year’s CMT Awards.</p><p>Although Underwood has neither confirmed nor denied having work done, she has talked about how she stays in such amazing shape. The mother of one admitted she was bullied at the beginning of her career, with people calling her fat. “It was definitely an introduction to being in the public eye, but it was also a catalyst for me to say, ‘OK, I’m not making some healthy choices and maybe I could do more of that. Not for those people, but for me,'” she told <a href=# title=_blank>Extra</a>. So, the singer began working out and eating right, and it made all the difference.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><p>Social media followers accused her of getting surgery again when she lost nearly all of her baby weight just seven months after giving birth to her son Isaiah. However, the new mom explained that her progress required good, old-fashioned work. “After I had Isaiah, my goal was to take control of my body again,” she said to <a href=# title=_blank>Shape</a>. “I was lucky: I gained only 30 pounds, which is the recommended amount, and I exercised throughout my pregnancy. When I got the OK from my doctor, I started exercising with my trainer. Now we box and we hike trails, among other things. I like to continually mix up my routines to stay motivated. But my favorite workout is Tabata, which I can do at home in about a half hour. It really revs up my metabolism.” Underwood has also been very open about her strict vegan diet.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Sunshine = ✔️ Lake = ✔️ @caliabycarrie swimsuit = ✔️ Happiness and love for time with family and friends = ✔️✔️✔️✔️✔️ Summertime is all about love…love for people, love for the outdoors and love for living in the moment!

Fortunately, she still finds a way to keep it light. “Tis a dark day today… I bought a bottle of wine at the store and didn’t get carded. #IFeelOld #SourGrapes #Sad,” she joked on Twitter. On a more serious note, Underwood has admitted that she struggles with body image issues too. In an interview with Allure, she revealed that she loves her legs but struggles with her tummy. “I’ve been trying to get abs for ten years now!” (Us too!)</p><p>This post originally appeared on our sister site, <a href=# title=_blank>Life & Style.</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>More From Life & Style</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">If You Want a Flat Stomach Like a Celebrity, Simply Stop Eating Bread and Start Eating Baby Food</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac Efron, Carrie Underwood, and More Stars You Didn’t Know Have a Third Nipple</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, and More ‘American Idol’ Contestants Who Got Married After the Show</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p7XRrKufp6KsvK6xzWeaqKVfpby0wNJom6KdpGSwor7RopxmrZ6ZsrPDzqibZp6RmLJuv9Srnp6qqWJ%2Bd32VaWo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
