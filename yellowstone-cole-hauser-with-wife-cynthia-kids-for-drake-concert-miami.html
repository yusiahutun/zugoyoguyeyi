How fun!! I bet Steely had a blast,” replied one. “Beautiful family!! And you guys are the cutest couple!!” added another. Meanwhile, a third penned: “Looks like a blast! I love how you guys have so much fun together.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/ab4d0f1474a5-cyn-hauser-cole-hauser-with-their-kids.jpg><p id=eVAE8FkCMfI data-wc=41>Cole and Cynthia’s oldest son Ryland was noticeably absent from the photos. However, the 19-year-old, who is incredibly close to his parents, recently embarked on his college career at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, so we imagine Ryland’s busy studying.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=ejefo4ew3V1 data-wc=49>Back in August, Cynthia revealed that she and Cole had moved their son into his dorm room at TCU.

U deserve it," which prompted the sweetest response from Ryland. "Love you Mom and Dad, going to miss y'all! Thank you for all you've done for me," he wrote in the comments. &nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Everything you need to know about the cast of Yellowstone</figure><p id=emlMPYaOXSd data-wc=45>While the SAG-AFTRA strikes have been keeping Cole away from the Yellowstone set, the last few months have remained incredibly busy for the star. Just last week, Cole jetted to New York where he took part in the Tunnel to Towers 5K Run & Walk.&nbsp;</p><p id=exDfZKelw7- data-wc=39>Braving the rain as he met with fellow participants and supporters, the actor, 48, shared a number of highlights from the event, which pays homage to the firefighters, law enforcement officers, and civilians who lost their lives during 9/11.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/61f979b58145-cole-hauser-tunnel-to-towers-event.jpg><p id=eDL6Pu3svbT data-wc=26>Posting several videos and photos from the run on Instagram, Cole wrote: "Amazing morning here in NY with everyone @tunnel2towers @nyfd9_11 @brandon.adam.19 #usastrong #neverforget @fdny @nypd."</p><p id=eBx5ItjSBLL data-wc=79>As of 2022, Cole has been working closely with Tunnel to Towers, and was even taken on an emotional tour of the sites of the 9/11 attacks in New York last November. Showing his support once more, Cole's new coffee company, Free Rein, also helped out at the charitable Bourbon & Bonfire event in August. Hosted by Cole in Montana, the event took place in support of both the Special Operations Warrior Foundation and the Tunnel To Towers Foundation.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dnySb21rZ6maua271qyrqKaVYrCwuMRmn5qto5q%2FbsPIrZ9mr5mbsm6v2KeroaGRYriqsNJmnaiqXZm%2ForfEZpqoppOav7V5zKKYpqFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
