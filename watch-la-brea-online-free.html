Hundreds of people, vehicles, buildings and more are sucked into the hole, which seems to extend to the very depths of the Earth. But instead of being killed by the accident, everyone who falls into the sinkhole ends up alive in what appears to be some kind of prehistoric world on the other side. The survivors—and those who remain above the sinkhole in Los Angeles—must all figure out a way to save themselves before the dangers of this primeval place are unleashed.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/zodiacastheofficecharacters.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/chrissy-metz.png><p>The survival drama, which premiered in September 2021, has already drawn comparisons to ABC’s Lost,&nbsp;which ran from 2004 to 2010.

The service offers over 75 live channels, including NBC to watch La Brea online for free with its <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">seven-day free trial</a>. In addition, you’ll have access to Hulu’s entire streaming library of 80,000 movies and TV shows, along with 50 hours of DVR. If you choose to stick with the service after your trial ends, you can expect to pay $65 per month—but if not, just make sure to cancel your subscription before your trial offer is up.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Fubo TV’s free trial</a> is another option to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">watch <i>La Brea </i>online for free</a>. Fubo TV currently offers a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">seven-day free trial</a>, giving you access to over 100 channels, including NBC, where you can watch La Brea online for free as it airs live. The service costs $65 per month after your free trial ends, so just remember to cancel your trial before it expires.</p><p>If you don’t mind waiting an extra day to watch La Brea online for free, consider <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu’s 30-day free subscription</a>. Hulu uploads new episodes of La Brea the day after they air, so fans of the show can easily catch up by the next morning. The service—which offers more than 1650 TV shows and 2,500 movies along with La Brea—starts at $5.99 per month for its <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">basic subscription</a> with ads. Its <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">ad-free</a> plan costs $11.99 per month. Both plans come with a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">30-day free trial</a>, so users can watch every episode of&nbsp;La Brea&nbsp;so far at no cost.</p><p>If you’re a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Verizon</a> customer (or know someone who is), this means you have access to yet another way to watch La Brea online for free. For a limited time, customers with unlimited plans, such as Get More Unlimited and Play More Unlimited, have access to Verizon’s complimentary <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The Disney Bundle</a>, which includes Disney+, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Hulu</a> and ESPN. While Disney+ and ESPN are amazing streamers to have access to, the real perk here is Hulu as it’s where you can watch La Brea online for free the day after its airs.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Verizon has a FAQ</a> that explains how to sign up for the Disney Bundle, which you can check out <a href=# rel=nofollow>here</a>.
