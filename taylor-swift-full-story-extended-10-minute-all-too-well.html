And like the first album she re-released, "Red TV" is jam-packed with bonus content, super-star collaborations, tracks "from the vault" -- and a version of "All Too Well" that's nearly twice as long as the original and, according to Taylor, the true original.</p><p>That means twice as much story, and Taylor definitely delivered on that front. Already lauded for its stellar lyrics in the original version, Rolling Stone gave the epic 30-track album five stars and said she's made a "classic even better."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:dbeffbe7-372c-4486-8264-66b77ce8fab4 data-container-ref=toofab:article:6c344912-cc80-49bd-9a2a-0447dd189d4f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/17/5by4/2021/11/11/1797795891ae442e93adca236156d31c_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Adele Says She was 'Devastated, Embarrassed' By Her Divorce: 'It Made Me Really Sad'</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The lyrical differences kicked off with authority in the second version with a vehement "f--- the patriarchy" over him tossing her the car keys.

But then her fans found it, and it became their favorite, as well.</p><p>"The way this song was written was I was going through a bit of a sad time," Taylor undersold the story of her at 21. In a story she's shared before, she was at band rehearsal playing four chords on repeat with her guitar when the band joined in and she started ad-libbing what would become the song.</p><p>But the version she ad-libbed, without her knowing it, was recorded by her sound guy and it's that version that basically makes up what's not been released.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:2e8e8a3c-57fc-4483-9177-a21dab516b6d data-container-ref=toofab:article:6c344912-cc80-49bd-9a2a-0447dd189d4f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ea/5by4/2021/11/11/ea03c7e696174591a017f33f7d5b4e14_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Why Hailey Baldwin Says It Was 'Extremely Difficult' Helping Justin Bieber Navigate His Sobriety</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I think I know what they are wanting," Taylor said when Fallon asked what she thinks the reaction from her fans will be. "I think the version that we're putting out tonight is gonna be for them the new standard of what this song is because it is the original form."</p><p>She also took some time to talk about the latest iteration of the story behind "All Too Well," which is coming to life in the form of a short film written, directed by and starring Taylor Swift, though not in the lead role. She nabbed Sadie Sink ("Stranger Things") and Dylan O'Brien ("Teen Wolf") for those honors. The film releases to YouTube Friday at 7 p.m. ET.</p><p>Later in the show, she talked about her penchant for Easter Eggs -- promising that the "All Too Well" music video is packed with them -- and even played a silly game of "Box of Lies" with Jimmy.</p><p>You can check those out below, and when you've got ten minutes and some change to spare, you've gotta immerse yourself in (Taylor's Version) of "All Too Well" with the lyric video above.
