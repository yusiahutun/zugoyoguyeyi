The Friends of Fairport Fish Hatchery has earned a $47,368 grant from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources for educational signage to preserve and interpret the hatchery.
The group wants the signage to be part of a project to teach visitors about the connection between the hatchery, Mississippi River mussels, and the pearl button industry that dominated Muscatine from the 1890s to the early 1930s."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On the north side of Highway 22…there were cottages for the staff that worked here back in the 20th century.”</p><p>Trails will take visitors through the ruins and through the hatchery.&nbsp;</p><p>Stevens, born and raised in Muscatine, lives in Louisville, Kentucky, but has a farm in Louisa County. His grandfather and great-grandfather were involved in Muscatine’s pearl button industry.</p><p>“It’s kind of helping the legacy live on. as a lifetime archaeologist, it gives me something to do in retirement that’s important to me,” he said. &nbsp;</p><p>Like Stevens, Andy Fowler, fisheries biologist and hatchery manager, hopes to create awareness about an important part of the region’s history. He brought Stevens’ attention to the grant.</p><p>“Many times, I hear people, even in the Muscatine area, say they didn’t realize we had a fish hatchery here,” Fowler said.</p><p>Fowler manages the hatchery where he moves fish in and out of ponds, stocking and harvesting ponds where fish such as bluegill and bass are raised. &nbsp;</p><p>“Prior to 2016, we were able to sell to private individuals,” he said. “Now we only stock public waters out of the station.”</p><p>“I’ve been here since 2016,” Fowler said. “After a few months, maybe a year or two, I quickly realized I need help from the local community to support this hatchery and to make it the success that I feel like it can be, to kind of show off that crown jewel that I think it was and still can be.”</p><p>“Organizations like the Friends group are really fundamental toward making that goal toward a reality,” Fowler said. “We desperately need that help.”</p><p>it will take about $100,000 for the pavilion project, where hatchery supporters hope busloads of students visit. the signage will have QR codes to allow visitors to access even more information online.</p><p>Stevens hopes the entire project will be done by December 2022 – a glowing tribute to river history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46lppyZnGK7psPSaJ2roZWjsbR5zp9kn5mZp72wvtNmnaKrmGK1osDCoZyrsV2oxKq5jK2msJmimXq1u9SroKysXZqxtq%2FAraCoppGheqLA06uYnKyZpLtw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
