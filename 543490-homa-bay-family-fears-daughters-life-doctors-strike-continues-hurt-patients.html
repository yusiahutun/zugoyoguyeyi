At one point, I was told it was TB and I had to get her medicine for the condition but the more she used them her condition persisted. On returning to the hospital twice, I was told that she had asthma and pneumonia," Akinyi said.<h2>Private hospitals in Homa Bay</h2><p class=align-left>She explained that this time, her daughter had a serious attack and could not go to school, something that pushed her to be admitted to St. Paul's Mission Hospital, a private hospital within the Homa Bay Town constituency, where she has been for over a week now.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/124c59191518e60a.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Joe Mudukiza: Man Who Wanted to Sleep Forever Laments as Conmen Solicit Money Online Using His Name</span></p></a>"I resorted to the private hospital because I heard that doctors were on strike, and my daughter wanted immediate attention," explained Akinyi.<p class=align-left>Atieno's father said his pockets have run dry since he has fully cared for his family during this difficult time without support from elsewhere.</p>"My daughter needs treatment badly, and I don't know what to do now that all the doctors are on strike," decried Okoth.<h2>Homa Bay family's medical appeal</h2><p class=align-left>They both sent their plea to any well-wisher to come to the rescue of their daughter, who, on the morning of Tuesday, April 2, 2024, was referred to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital (JOOTRH) in Kisumu or <a href=#>Kenyatta National Hospital</a> (KNH) in Nairobi.</p>"We're asking our local leaders and any well-wishers to help us treat our daughter. She belongs to this county, and a child is for everyone," Akinyi and Okoth pleaded.<p class=align-left>According to Julia Wasonga, a nurse at St Paul's Mission Hospital, Atieno was admitted on Saturday, March 23, 2024, and required three investigations into her condition, two of which turned out negative.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/bd7a3be8a707327c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nairobi Smokie Seller Abandons Job to Help Expectant Mother Deliver: "Daktari Alisema Ako Busy"</span></p></a><h2>Examining heart conditions</h2><p class=align-left>However, the medics at the facility did not have the equipment to conduct a third test that could help establish Atieno's illness.</p>"We suspected the patient could be having a heart problem. It needs a cardiologist to confirm that. We referred her to JOOTRH, where a cardiologist can check on her. Her parents cannot afford an appointment with the specialist at a private hospital."We have managed the patient's condition, but we are unable to give her sustainable support, and she is deteriorating," Wasonga said.<p class=align-left><a href=# rel=noopener>Kenya</a>n doctors under the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists and Dentists Union have been on a nationwide strike for over 21 days.</p><p class=align-left>They have been pushing the government to keep its pledge and<a href=#> implement a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)</a> to improve their working conditions.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnC3xKewmmeTpMKvwMieqmhtZGiBenyMoaammV2Xrrp5xZqkoqSpYrOmrdGsZJ2ZpZy1tbHRrGSloZaaeqW7wq2mq6tdqMGztcqeZJynnqm2r8HErGShraKperGt06Kcp6yjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
