Robert and Jo Ann Madison, from Tampa, Florida, are seeking more than US$25,000 each in compensatory and punitive damages for libel, slander and defamation. They say they have been loving, supportive and generous parents. Tianna Madison was on the winning 4x100-metre relay track team at the Summer Olympics in London. She won the gold with Allyson Felix, Bianca Knight and Carmelita Jeter in world record time. The lawsuit also names her husband, John Bartoletta.

In the end, both men were arrested. The new boyfriend, Kenneth Smith, 26, was arrested on charges of making a hoax threat to police in Philadelphia, who recalled a Dallas-bound flight and marched Christopher Shell off the plane on Thursday. The episode led to Shell's own arrest on drug warrants after he finally reached Texas to celebrate his 29th birthday.

Ellis Ward, 29, posted on Twitter about life as a Metropolitan Police inspector on the streets of London tackling rioters and looters, and duped one British newspaper into printing a column about his duties. He also pretended to be an army major wounded in Iraq, swindling three women out of more than £40,000 (HK$2 million). Ward admitted to 18 charges of fraud at his trial.
