One of the “most iconic Nancy looks,” of course, a dark pink shearling-lined jacket. “I now see people wear [it] and oh my gosh, I should have kept that jacket, it was so good,” she tells me.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Curtis Baker/Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Nancy and Natalia have more in common than a shared love of shearling, though. Dyer is dating her Stranger Things co-star Charlie Heaton both onscreen and off, and their couple’s style is an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>inspiration to stans</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>fashion editors</a> alike. Their sartorial sensibilities complement each other so perfectly, it’s hard to imagine they don’t purposefully coordinate their outfits. But, according to Dyer herself, they do not. “No!” she says with a laugh. “That’s literally never on purpose. You do see articles, and no, we didn’t. I feel like we would naturally go out of our way to not, but it just happens. Kind of a thing.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>The Image Direct</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jacopo Raule/Getty Images</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dominik Bindl/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to both date night and dressing for the winter months, Dyer’s directive is “cozy.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I think the ideal is a cozy, candle-lit kind of restaurant, maybe a fun bar, just walking around. Somewhere where you can hear each other talk,” she says of her perfect night out.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As the temperature drops, Dyer relies on “Layers. So many layers.” She’s no martyr for fashion. “Eventually it gets to be like just marshmallow,” she says, “everything that I can possibly get on my body. I’m very cold sensitive.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Next up for the actress? Stranger Things 4, which begins shooting at the beginning of next year. “We don’t know anything,” she says of the upcoming season.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: 7 Things to Know About Stranger Things Star Natalia Dyer</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">One thing we do know?
