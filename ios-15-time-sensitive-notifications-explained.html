 What Are Time-Sensitive Notifications in iOS 15?

Focus allows you to decide who can contact you and which apps can send notifications during a specific time.</p><p>It's a handy way to help you tune out the noise to focus on the task at hand, such as working, sleeping, reading, or driving. Focus Mode is one of a few <a href=#>new productivity features introduced in iOS 15</a>.</p><p>But while blocking out the noise is good, not all notifications need to be silenced. Some notifications, like a transaction alert from your bank, impact you directly and should be acted on without delay.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>That is where time-sensitive notifications come in, allowing you to block notifications without missing out on essential alerts. Time-sensitive notifications break through your different Focus modes and remain on your Lock Screen for an hour so you can act on them with the urgency they require.</p><p>Apple categorizes notification interruptions into four levels: passive, active, time-sensitive, and critical. Let's break down each to help you understand them better.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>iOS delivers <strong>passive</strong> notifications (those that don't need immediate attention) silently without triggering sounds and vibrations and lighting up the screen. <strong>Active</strong>, the default interruption level, are the regular notifications that will produce sound and vibrations and light up the screen. <strong>Time-sensitive</strong> notifications are the special kind that will alert you, like active ones, but with a high priority of breaking through enabled system controls like Focus mode and Notification Summary.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Set Up and Use the Notification Summary on Your iPhone and iPad</a></span></p><p><strong>Critical</strong> notifications, first introduced in iOS 14, have a higher priority than time-sensitive as they can bypass the ringer switch alert. Critical notifications only apply to sensitive cases like severe weather alerts and local safety alerts. And due to their nature, Apple has to grant an app developer permission individually to deliver critical notifications.</p><h2 id=what-39-s-the-best-way-to-use-time-sensitive-notifications>What's the Best Way to Use Time-Sensitive Notifications?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/downgrade-from-ios-15-beta-to-ios-14.jpg><p>Apple has given developers a way to categorize their notifications to fit the different interruption levels. But due to the way time-sensitive notifications work, you should be cautious about which apps you grant this kind of privilege to.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>If misused, time-sensitive notifications will invade your peace of mind.
