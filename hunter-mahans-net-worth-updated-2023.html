He then attended the University of Texas while starting his career as a golfer.</p><p>In 1994, he became the NCAA champion, a competition that is considered the premier event in U.S. men’s collegiate golf.</p><p>His family became involved in his career, with his mom dealing with the logistics, and his dad handling the investments and schedule of events.</p><p>Justin’s sister was also a big help to his career with her extensive knowledge of public relations and the media.</p><p>For the three years from 1992 to 1994, Justin won the U.S Amateur championship and became a two-time All-<a href=#>American</a>.</p><p>He won the Haskins Award in 1994, his first major award, and went on to be the fourth golfer to go straight from college to the PGA Tour without help from a Q School.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career></span>Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin’s career started very well with his first win on the PGA Tour in 1997 at the Open Championship and the following year, in 1998, he snagged the Players Championship.</p><p>During this time, he ranked as one of the top 10 in the Official World Golf Ranking, a position he occupied for 24 weeks, and in 1997, 1999, and 2008, he qualified for the United States Ryder Cup team.</p><p>Justin&nbsp;moved his family to Aspen, Colorado in 2015, where he continued to train and pursue his golfing career, but&nbsp;it wasn’t long before he decided to change&nbsp;careers and signed on&nbsp;as a golf announcer and commentator later that year.</p><p>He joined Golf Central’s “Live From” as an analyst for the PGA Tour live tournament commentary, but while&nbsp;pursuing&nbsp;his career in television, he still felt like he wasn’t yet finished with his golfing career.</p><p>Leonard returned for a limited number of tournaments during the 2016 season, only playing in a total of 16 events throughout that year. The following year, he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;qualify&nbsp;for the 2017 Texas Open but only managed 58th place.</p><p>Justin Leonard was never able to reach the heights of players like Gary Play, Ernie Els,&nbsp;and Jack Nicklaus, who managed to stay ahead of the pack for most of their careers.</p><p>Recently, he returned to play at an event on the PGA tour early in 2022 but failed to make the cut.</p><p>This is not the last we’ll see of Justin as he qualifies for the PGA Tour Champions events once he turns 50.</p><p>In the meantime, he continues to provide fans with the benefit of his 3 decades of pro golfing experience as he commentates on the current tour.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-leonard%e2%80%99s-career-earnings></span>Justin Leonard’s Career Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin has earned a huge amount over the years, raking in more than $36 million in winnings, not to mention his earnings from sponsorships and endorsements.</p><p>His most successful year was in 2008 when he won more than $4 million in prize money on the circuit.</p><p>Here’s an estimated overview of Justin Leonard’s annual income:</p><ul><li>Justin Leonard’s Salary In 2013 – $1.7 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Salary In 2014 – $2.9 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Salary In 2015 – $2,3 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Salary In 2016 – $1.7 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Salary In 2017 – $1.1 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Salary In 2018 – $100,000</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Salary In 2019 – $250,000</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Salary In 2020 – $250,000</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Salary In 2021 – $300,000</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Salary In 2022 – <strong>$350,000</strong></li></ul><p>Once Justine had left the regular tour in 2017, his earnings took a big dip as he pursued a more leisurely, family-focused life.</p><p>After taking on the role of golf commentator in 2018 and securing a 2-year contract, Justine realized that his heart just wasn’t in it anymore and only played a couple of rounds of <a href=#>professional</a> golf.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=justin-leonard%e2%80%99s-net-worth-annually></span>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth Annually<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After earning millions during the course of his <a href=#>professional</a> career, Justine decided that he wanted a change of scenery.</p><p>To that end, he and his wife discussed moving to Aspen, Colorado, as it was the family’s favorite getaway destination.</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of Justin Leonard’s annual net worth:</p><ul><li>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth In 2013 – $22.6 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth In 2014 – $22.9 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth In 2015 – $23.1 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth In 2016 – $23.5 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth In 2017 – $23.8 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth In 2018 – $24 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth In 2019 – $24.1 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth In 2020 – $24.3 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth In 2021 – $24.5 million</li><li>Justin Leonard’s Net Worth In 2022 – <strong>$25 million</strong></li></ul><p>Without having to worry about having the facilities to practice golf year-round, Aspen was the perfect place for Leonard to de-stress.</p><p>He’d spent many years on the PGA tour and realized that he needed the break and time to enjoy his family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=personal-life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Justin married his wife, Amanda Leonard, who worked for CNN in Atlanta before moving to Dallas, Texas, in 2002.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple went on to have three daughters; Reese Ella Leonard, Skylar Charles Leonard, and Avery Kate Leonard, and a son, Luke Garrett Leonard.</p><p>While the children were young, the family would travel to a lot for Justin’s tournaments.
