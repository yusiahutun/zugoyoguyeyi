World Darts Federation star Viktor Tingstrom suffered an unfortunate bounce out against Connor Hopkins in Group A of the MODUS Super Series on Wednesday. In only the third leg of the best of seven contest, Tingstrom found himself in command of the leg, but it soon threatened to get away from him due to an unruly arrow."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But Hopkins was soon gifted his way back into the leg following a darting mishap from his opponent.</p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Fans have just discovered Peter Drury commentating on darts before football fame</a></b></p><p><b>READ MORE: <a data-content-type=news data-link-tracking=InArticle|Link href=#>Gerwyn Price issues new PDC plea after getting beat in World Grand Prix final</a></b></p><p>Tingstrom’s first dart landed in the single five before his second bounced off the wire of the T20 and came flying back through the air at him. The Swede attempted to get out of the arrow’s path by leaning his body away, but his feet weren’t quick enough to get out of harm's way.</p><p>He immediately looked down at his feet to spot the dart sticking out of his shoe before smirking at the referee in shock. The referee and Hopkins both stepped in to help free the dart from his shoe but Tingstrom had already managed to wriggle it out.</p><p><b><i>Have you ever seen a bounce out land so awkwardly?

Hopkins, ranked 43 on the PDC Development Tour, had his woeful finishing to blame for the defeat with him pinning just one of his 13 attempts at a double.</p><p>Tingstorm landed his first title win on the WDF tour as he lifted the Finnish Masters in September, beating Brian Lokken 5-1 in the final, who had previously knocked out 2016 World Championship semi-finalist Jelle Klassen in the semi-final. The Cobra re-joined the WDF last year after falling to 131 in the PDC Order of Merit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCsrJGne6S7ja6iaKugpL%2B1e8Oaqa2rX5mus8DSZpmorZ6Ysm671K1koqakpHq0tM6eZGxpYWuEc3%2BR</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
