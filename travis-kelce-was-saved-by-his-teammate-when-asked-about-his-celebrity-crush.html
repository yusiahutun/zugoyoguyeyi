As part of the Kansas City Chiefs, <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a> was playing at<strong> </strong>Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri<strong> </strong>against the Chicago Bears. Since then, Tay Tay has been to 13 out of the 19 games the Chiefs have played. The pair then celebrated after the Chiefs won at this year’s <a href=#>Super Bowl</a>. They gave us <a href=#>real-life fairytale PDA</a> on the field, but we can imagine it may not have happened if Travis’ teammate hadn’t stepped in earlier that month …</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-swift-is-travis-kelce-s-celebrity-crush>Taylor Swift is Travis Kelce’s celebrity crush</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-1996273423-1024x683.jpg><p>In a video released in September, members of the Chiefs were asked about famous faces they had the hots for when they were younger, and they seemed to have an easy time answering.</p><p>However, when it came to Travis, he seemed uneasy.</p><p>When he was quizzed about his <a href=#>celebrity</a> crush, Travis Kelce stuttered and seemed unsure of where to look or what to say. When he began, “mine was …” his teammate, Marquez Valdes-Scantling, quickly jumped in. With a teasing tone, he suggested “Taylor Swift?”</p><p><strong>OMG: </strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift finally goes ‘official’ with Travis Kelce on TikTok – it only took 6 months</a></p><p>In response, the 34-year-old began laughing nervously.</p><p>However, when this clip came out, no one knew they were dating in secret and had already enjoyed their first dates. Eagle-eyed fans noticed how when Travis was asked about his celeb crush, his teammate was actually helping him out. One, to make sure he didn’t say someone else, as that would be awkward. But some felt he was teasing the 34-year-old, because the world had no idea they were official yet.</p><p>Before they got together, Travis called out the hitmaker on his podcast New Heights, which he co-hosts with brother <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a>. He wanted to give Taylor a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it. However, she denied the request as she had to rest before and after shows because of how intense they are.</p><p>But we find out later, they managed to connect through a mutual friend after his podcast. The rest is history.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-loved-how-travis-put-her-on-blast>Taylor loved how Travis put her on ‘blast’</h2><p>Taylor, 34, told TIME in 2023 when she was named their Person of the Year that she and Travis had already been dating for a month when she attended her first game. The <a href=#>music</a> star said he had “put her on blast” on the podcast he does with his brother Travis.</p><p>She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told</a> the publication: “We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.</p><p>“By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.”</p><p>“When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” she says. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”</p><p>Fans in the comments were quick to defend Travis after others wrote they thought whatever may have left the NBA player’s mouth next could’ve led to a breakup album.</p><p>“He got saved. He had that nervous laugh,” wrote one person.</p><p>Another said: “MVS saved him from Being in a breakup song.”</p><p>A third penned: “Yep true teammate.”</p><p>Others were quick to defend him.</p><p>“They weren’t publicly together yet when this was filmed, so chill people no one would make a fuss,” commented one person.</p><p>A second said: “That laugh was of a smart man. He’s not going there. It’s a trick question [upside-down smile face emoji].”</p><p>Somebody else questioned: “How the heck is she gonna be his crush as a kid if they are the same age.”</p><p><strong>SO CUTE: </strong><a href=#>Super Bowl: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce serenade each other at the after party</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2aAcMDRmq2iq12gsq2vxGaumqtdqK63scNmmbJlmJ7AbsDEmqSmmaSaeri0xKdkmqubmrFurcGorK1lmJ7Abq%2FEpZybqpmpxm6v0a6qoWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
