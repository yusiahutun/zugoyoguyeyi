In a video posted to social media by stepmother Brittany, little Kendyl demonstrates how sweetly she handles toddler Memphis and infant Navy.</p><p>In the clip, Memphis is trying to help his big sis burp lil' sis Navy, using the time-honored method of thumping the baby on her back. Boys being boys, however, he gets a bit too enthusiastic, and his pats start to get a little too rough.</p><p>"Careful," advises Kendyl. "Careful...." But when Memphis just gets too slap-happy, Kendyl emits an adorable, "Okay, okay, okay," and takes the baby out of his reach.</p><p>Kendyl is the second of Aldean's four children; she and her older sister Keeley are from his first marriage to Jessica Ussery. Aldean has noted that both of his older girls are good with the younger kids, but that Kendyl is particularly handy, and was a big help when Memphis (who will turn 2 in December) was born.</p><p>“They’ve been really good with [Memphis], you know, both of them — but especially Kendyl,” Aldean explained&nbsp;<a href=#>during an interview</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=#>Kix Brooks</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;American Country Countdown. “She's the one who wants to really help out a lot—feed him, burp him and change him. She sits there on the couch with him and watches TV, and hangs out with him.”</p><p>It looks as if the little girl is transferring her skills neatly to her youngest sibling, who was born in February.</p><p>Aldean released his most recent album,&nbsp;Rearview Town, in April 2018. The record's title track is his current single.</p><p><strong>Check Out Jason Aldean's Fairytale Mansion</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5mjpLturcudnJqmo2KxosHGoaueql2htq150qKZpaGenMBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
