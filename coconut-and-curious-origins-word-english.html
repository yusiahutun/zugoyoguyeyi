However, its ultimate origins (a subject of controversy) lie in the Central Indo-Pacific, the region between western Southeast Asia and Melanesia, recent studies showing the greatest genetic diversity there (with other evidence deriving from coconut crabs’ native habitats and specific pests).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">First domesticated by the Austronesian peoples of Maritime Southeast Asia, coconuts were carried to the Pacific during early Neolithic ocean migrations 4,500 years ago, and Micronesia. Similarity in the names for “coconut” (and its parts and uses) in the region lend support: across Polynesian languages such as Tongan, Samoan, Tahitian and Hawaiian, it is niu, while other Austronesian languages include niu, such as in Fijian and in Sa’a of the Solomon Islands, the Tagalog niyog and Malay niur.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Brought to India before the first century BC from Sri Lanka (having been introduced there earlier by the Austronesians), the word for coconut in Dravidian languages, such as the Tamil tēṅkāy, reflects this route, being a compound of the words of “south” and “fruit”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So whence “coconut”? The Portuguese first encountered the plant in their colonies in India. Curiously, they didn’t adopt a local term for the fruit (as was done with numerous other cultural words during their Asian empire), nor use the existing term nux indica, “Indian nut”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/09/01/a0c9471c-36ea-4c4e-a4f5-7107aa27340b_0b74b60b.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Rather, on account of the face-like appearance conveyed by the characteristic three holes on the base of the coconut shell, the Portuguese (and Spanish) bequeathed the name “coco”, referencing a skull, head or round mask used to frighten children, an extension of el Coco, ghost-monster, kidnapper and eater of disobedient children of Iberian folklore.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">From South Asia, the Portuguese introduced the coconut to the Atlantic, first to coastal West Africa, then the Caribbean and Brazil’s east coast (with Arab and Persian traders taking them to the East African coast), while the Spanish introduced coconuts from the Spanish East Indies to Mexico. But it was their moniker coco that was transmitted, subsequently adopted as the Dutch coquos, and cemented in English, via travel writings, original and translated, from the 16th century onwards, as coco (though for a while alternating with cocoa) to give coco + nut.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1753, this became its genus in Linnaeus binomial nomenclature: Cocos nucifera (the latter species name meaning “nut-bearing”).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An important economic crop for many communities, we celebrated this “tree of life” on World Coconut Day, on September 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOrJ%2BoqqRiv6atw6xmmqqknrCtsY5saG1vYW6DcK%2FOnKanraRirq%2BwjJysq6GfqsBuu9GinqKmo2LEsL7DZpynn5yewKk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
