When many details are the same, why is it shamelessly called a ‘new design’ and ‘hallmark Dior silhouette’?” fumed an opinion piece published by People.cn, an online portal of Communist Party mouthpiece People’s Daily.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The commentary, published on Saturday with the hashtag “cultural appropriation” on Chinese social media platform Weibo, accusing it of the unacknowledged adoption of foreign cultural elements.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/17/23083608-6ffd-4c40-aaed-cd63d9ad412d_1c450301.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Chinese horse-face skirt, or ma mian qun, dates back to the 10th century Song dynasty and was commonly worn by women during the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The wraparound garment features pleated fabric on either side when draped. Four slits down the sides make it suitable for horse-riding, though its name refers not to the animal but to defensive structures jutting out over city walls in ancient China.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The People.cn piece called on Dior to respond to the controversy and offer details on its design which has “stirred public opinion, raised questions among netizens and has continued to ferment”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Dior should respond to the concerns of [Chinese] netizens as soon as possible. This would show that an internationally renowned company [such as Dior] is responsible for its own corporate culture and pays tribute to world history and cultural heritage,” it said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dior has been contacted for comment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/07/17/1090d297-31eb-4d39-9c2b-a1e41d4303b9_446612c9.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While the skirt can no longer be found on its mainland China site, and was marked as “sold out” on the Hong Kong site, it is still available in the city’s physical Dior stores for HK$30,000 (US$3,820).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Hong Kong site describes the “flared skirt” with “pleated style” as “a hallmark Dior silhouette, the mid-length skirt … updated with a new elegant and modern variation”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In response, a Weibo history blogger posted: “I hope copyright lawyers and experts from cultural preservation units will jointly evaluate this matter and pay attention to its foulness. This is not just plagiarism.”</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Dior pulls photo Chinese state media slammed for ‘smearing Asian women’</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The horse-face skirt has drawn the attention of French fashion houses before, but with due recognition of the source of inspiration. Chanel’s 2010 Paris-Shanghai collection was inspired by elements from Chinese culture and included a shortened horse-face skirt.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This is not the first time that Dior – part of the world’s largest luxury group, LVMH – has sparked controversy in China. Last year, it took down a photo at a Lady Dior show in Shanghai after it was criticised for perpetuating stereotypes and “smearing Asian women” with its portrayal of “spooky eyes” and a “gloomy face”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">State-owned newspaper Beijing Daily slammed the photo with the headline: “Is This the Asian Woman in Dior’s Eyes?”</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn2.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/video/thumbnail/dg-racist_thumbnail-plain.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:39</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Dolce & Gabbana cancels Shanghai show after racist outburst on founder’s Instagram account</p><p>Dolce & Gabbana cancels Shanghai show after racist outburst on founder’s Instagram account</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2019, Italian label Dolce & Gabbana was forced to cancel a high-profile fashion show in Shanghai after posting a video featuring a Chinese model eating Italian food with chopsticks. The clip was called out on social media for what was seen as a disrespectful and demeaning depiction.</p>Global brands <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">H&M and Nike</span></a> were also in the cross hairs of Chinese consumers last year, but not for design reasons. The backlash came after the two firms pledged to shun cotton from the far-western Chinese region of Xinjiang over allegations of forced labour involving the mainly Muslim Uygur population.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miaoaGelnyxu8uiq6Kbo2Sus8DInKOeZ2NmhXaBlmtmnaGfp3qlvsCwqmaeoprAqXnFoqmeZZOdtq%2BtjK2gpp1dpMOmvoyhmKWknZa%2FrHnSpKCrrF2nsrSxzJujoqaX</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
