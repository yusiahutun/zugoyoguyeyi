In Us Weekly’s exclusive clip of the Wednesday, November 29, episode, S’more gives Thicke, 46, a major hint by revealing that they’ve actually hung out in the past.
“Robin, I’ve been inside your house,” the mystery singer says. “And you have great taste in music and home decor."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

McCarthy, 51, has also guessed <strong>Justin Guarini</strong>, who wasn’t in a boy band but rose to fame shortly after the heyday of the Backstreet Boys and similar groups.</p><p>The Masked Singer has hosted several boy banders <a href=#>in past seasons</a>, including ’NSync’s<strong> Joey Fatone</strong> in season 1, Backstreet Boys’ <strong>Nick Carter</strong> in season 4 and New Edition’s <a href=#><strong>Bobby Brown</strong> in season 5</a>. That season — which also featured all three members of Hanson as the Russian Dolls — marked the first time a boy bander <a href=#>won the top prize</a>, with <a href=#><strong>Nick Lachey</strong> of 98 Degrees</a> taking home the Golden Mask as Piglet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Robin-Thicke-Thinks-a-Backstreet-Boy-Is-Under-the-Smore-Costume-on-%E2%80%98The-Masked-Singer2.jpg><p>After his win, Lachey, 50, revealed that Fatone, 46, actually gave him tips on how to succeed on The Masked Singer. “I talked to him after he was the Rabbit in the first season,” Lachey told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Weekly</a> in May 2021. “He’s like, ‘Dude, if you ever do this, you have to, like, give your character a personality and have fun with it.’ So, that’s what I tried to do. I tried to just go in there and have fun and be silly and do things I wouldn’t be able to do as Nick Lachey, but you can definitely do as Piglet.”</p><p>The Masked Singer airs on Fox Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmompmjerW0yJyinmWknbavt9JmmGaan656o63NnZyrZZmoerS5zqucZqeeYsGpsYymmKyjlZl6tLXNoJyrZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
