The answer is no. Tyler and Hall confirmed in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in September 2023 that they aren’t still together after their first kiss in the Selling The OC Season 2 finale.</p><p>“I think we’re still navigating our friendship. Obviously, you see in Season 2 [that] we explore some things. It leads to a steamy moment and I think we’re still kind of trying to figure it out, but we remain really close friends and I don’t have an answer [on where we stand] for you at the moment,” Tyler said at the time. Hall, for her part, teased that fans will “have to stick around [for] Season 3” to see what happened to her and Tyler’s relationship after their kiss.</p><p>She continued, “You see throughout season 2 the dynamic of our friendship, and it’s easy and it’s comfortable because there it is, just that. It’s a friendship. There’s no strings attached and I think adding that other element is scary. … Some things are awkward, you know what I mean? And you can’t avoid it. So we’re just navigating.”</p><p>Tyler also explained that he and Hall didn’t pursue a relationship after their kiss because of what’s “at stake” if they cross that line in their friendship. “It’s both a blessing and a curse to explore a relationship that starts out as a friendship,” he said. “There’s a lot of things that come with it and there’s a lot more at stake as well.”</p><p>Polly Brindle, Tyler and Alex’s Selling The OC co-star, told Us Weekly that she wasn’t surprised by their kiss in the Season 2 finale. “I was like, ‘Come on, guys, this is going to happen.’ You can feel it building up. It’s kind of like the Ross and the Rachel of the office,” Polly said, referring to the Friends couple. “I was all for it!”</p><p>Tyler and Hall also confirmed in an interview with Entertainment Tonight in September 2023 that they weren’t still together following their kiss in the Selling The OC Season 2 finale, choosing to focus on their “friendship” instead. “We are navigating our friendship right now,” Hall said. “That’s our priority.”</p><p>She continued, “You guys get to have a first look at what we went through. I think one thing about this show, and this cast is, we are all— most of us—we wear our hearts on our sleeves and we’re not afraid to give you guys 110 percent of us, and that also plays into Season 3 and where the finale of Season 2 left off with Tyler and I in the hot tub.”</p><p>Hall went on to tease her relationship with Tyler in Selling The OC Season 3. “I’m excited to see season 3,” she said. “I was very excited to watch season 2 and our moments, and the whole season and, altogether, I think was great and I think our friendship is cute. We have little time capsules now, sweet moments.”</p><p>As for why the kiss happened if they chose to stay friends, Tyler told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">USA Today</a> in September 2023 that “there was a lot of buildup” in the lead up to his and Hall’s first intimate moment. “We were spending a lot of time together, and our friendship was also evolving. We had had a couple conversations before that of just like, ‘Is there something here? Is there not?’ And ultimately, we decided to put a pin in it and just be friends,” he said.</p><p>He continued, “For whatever reason, after 14 hours in the jacuzzi, it just kind of all started pouring out of me. I don’t really know why, that night, other than it just felt like the right time, right place.” Hall also confirmed to USA Today that she and Tyler are “still very close.” “We’re still very good friends, and just navigating uncharted territory,” she said.</p><p>Tyler also explained his hesitation of pursuing a romantic relationship with Hall. “She is very important in my life, and depending on the day, I think I’m important in hers, and so there was a lot more pressure to exploring what this is or may be,” he said. “We’re just delicately figuring it out.”</p><p>As for if their relationship could ever become romantic in the future, Tyler told USA Today, “Right now, I’m just taking it one day at a time, focusing on life and work and not overthinking everything else. Just seeing where the cards fall.” Hall added, “Less thinking, more feeling.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6KqratfqcatsdFmqq2Znpa5orrDZpilnahitaK4y2aqraGcoXq1u8aeq6GdomLAprjLoqWgZZ%2BYfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
