It’s not very often that we get excited about fruit, but hear us out: Pitaya—aka dragonfruit—isn’t your run-of-the-mill produce.
To start, pitaya is just pretty. With its hot-pink skin and polka dot inside flesh, if this superfood was an accessory it would be by Charlotte Olympia.
Thusly, the color lends the fruit perfectly to social media, which is why you’ve seen the snack popping up in #foodstagrams of smoothie bowls, salads, and sliced up whole."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She blogs at <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Flexi Foodie</a>, and her&nbsp;new cookbook,&nbsp;<span class=s1>Superfoods: The Flexible Approach to Eating More Superfood&nbsp;</span><span class=s1>is a best-seller in the UK and has just hit bookshelves locally.</span></p><p><span class=s1>Ahead, she broke down&nbsp;five major ways the superfood can be beneficial&nbsp;to your health—from anti-aging to disease prevention.</span></p><p><span class=s1>Not only does pitaya look and taste good, but it contains important elements that can help you avoid sickness. “T</span><span class=s2>his fruit is a powerhouse,” Montagu explained. “It’s one of the most phyto-nutrient dense fruits around.—and the more phyto-nutrients, the healthier the body as photo-nutrients help fight diseases.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>You’ve heard it before, but superfoods packed with antioxidants are a powerful way to keep your skin looking young. Montagu explains: “Pitaya is so rich with antioxidants that it helps keep the skin tight and young—it even gives acai berry a run for its money with the amount of antioxidants it contains.”</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>If&nbsp;you don’t like the taste, Montagu recommends using it to make an at-home, anti-aging face mask: “</span><span class=s1>Simply mash the fruit into a small bowl, add a good squirt of honey and add&nbsp;add half a teaspoon&nbsp;of spirulina for a true superfood&nbsp;mask.”</span></p><p class=p1>To make the most of all the fibre in dragonfruit, eat the entire fruit: “<span class=s1>When eating a pitaya, try to eat the skin and the seeds as this is where the bulk of the fibre is. &nbsp;And the more fibre, the cleaner our digestive system which in turn helps keep our bodies clean.”</span></p><p class=p1>Although one small pitaya has just 60 calories (less than a boiled egg), it’s extremely filling and can help support weight management. “<span class=s1>Pitayas are also extremely low in calories but, thanks to all of the fibre, are still quite filling,&nbsp;which is great for weight loss.”</span></p><p>If you have dry, brittle, or colored hair that’s in need of a little love, Montagu recommends trying&nbsp;the food as a hair mask. “<span class=s1>Yes, seriously! Just mash some pitaya and then massage into the hair and scalp. &nbsp;The nutritional composition of the pitaya helps to keep the hair follicles open so that your hair stays healthy and smooth.”</span></p><p>So, how—and how often—should you be eating (and Instagramming) it? Try making it one of your daily serves of fruit by dicing it up into salads&nbsp;or as an extra ingredient in smoothies.&nbsp;If your grocery store doesn’t stock pitaya, <a href=# rel=nofollow>you can order smoothie packs online</a> right here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZK%2BmrdStsGhsaGaEdX2Onaman5%2Bjeqe%2B1KKrZpqVo7KntdOsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
