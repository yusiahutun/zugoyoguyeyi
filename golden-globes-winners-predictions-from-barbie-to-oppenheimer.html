The presitigous event celebrates the <a href=#>movie</a> and TV shows from the previous year. The accolades have been running since 1944 and represents the start of the award season in <a href=#>Hollywood</a>. We’ve taken a look at IMDB reviews, Rotten Tomatoes scores, social media influence and much more to determine who could be among the Golden Globes winners list this season.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-does-the-voting-work-for-the-winners-of-the-golden-globes>How does the voting work for the winners of the Golden Globes?</h2><p>In 2021, it was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found</a> by the LA Times, among many concerns from the industry one of the biggest criticism is that there were no black voters within the 87 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) – those who vote for the awards which win. There were also concerns about ethics within the body, as they would accept “freebies” from PR agencies and studios who were campaigning to see their films, actors, and crews take home accolades.</p><p>However, it now seems that there have been positive changes made. The HFPA announced it would make an effort to diversify its members and would bring in a ban on the “freebies”. They have also <a href=# rel=nofollow>added</a> to the number of voters to represent a more diverse pool.</p><p>After bycotss from certain stars to be a no-show, A-listers seem to have agreed to attend this year’s <a href=#>award ceremony</a>. This includes Quentin Tarantino and Jamie Lee Curtis who will be presenting awards. Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie, <a href=#>Rihanna</a>, and Jenna Ortega are also set to be present, according to the award’s official X (formerly Twitter) account.</p><p>HFPA members nominate who they think should win each category in November. They cast their top five votes, numbering them from 5 to 1 (5 is the top choice). The nominees are the list of contenders who receive the most votes. After, HFPA members receive teh final ballots and they vote who they think should win that category. If there is a tie when it comes down to the Golden Globes winners, the association use the ranked voting system in teh beginning to determine who had the highest number (5 to 1).</p><p>Those up for big, and many, trophies include Barbie, Oppenheimer, Succession, and Only Murders in the Building.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-golden-globe-awards-movie-nominations-and-who-we-predict-will-be-winners>Golden Globe Awards movie nominations – and who we predict will be winners</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-best-motion-picture-drama><strong>Best Motion Picture – Drama</strong></h2><p><strong>Oppenheimer</strong></p><p>Christopher Nolan’s latest blockbuster tells the story of J.
