 Don't copy those slouching celebs. Bad posture won't just cause a bad back, but depression too!At first glance, it was hard to put a finger on it. As the succession of celebrities stepped on to the red carpet at the Golden Globes, there was no denying that most of the outfits were exquisite."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As the succession of celebrities stepped on to the red carpet at the Golden Globes, there was no denying that most of the outfits were exquisite.</span></p><p><span>The jewels and accessories were dazzling, while the hair and make-up was perfect. Yet many of the female actresses and ­singers looked distinctly uncomfortable in front of the world’s cameras. The reason? Their posture was appalling.</span></p><p><span>Actress Michelle Williams looked round-shouldered in her putty-coloured number by Valentino, while country music star Carrie Underwood’s sunken chest did nothing for her strapless sequin dress. Even the statuesque Tilda Swinton appeared to stoop.</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/24/article-1349819-0CD43BD4000005DC-567_306x537.jpg height=537 width=306 alt="Actress Emma Watson" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/24/article-1349819-0CE0D8FC000005DC-599_306x537.jpg height=537 width=306 alt="Anne Hathaway" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Slouching: Emma Watson, left, and Anne Hathaway strike ungainly poses on the red carpet<br></p><p><span>And it’s not only celebrities whose posture is shocking. One in five people in Britain visits their GP complaining of back pain each year — yet many of them could be cured by learning to stand and sit properly.</span></p><p><span>It’s not only spinal problems either. Researchers at North State Dakota ­University have found a link between poor posture and depression, and many experts believe stooping and slouching could be associated with weight gain, heartburn, migraines, anxiety and ­respiratory conditions.</span></p><p><span>So, what is good posture and how can we achieve it?</span></p><br><p style=color:#d42699;font-weight:700><span>MINOR ACHES</span></p><p style=color:#d42699;font-weight:700><span>Children as young as seven are suffering back problems due to poor posture</span></p><p><span>‘By drawing back the shoulders we c­reate enough space within the body for the ­connective tissues inside to align ­themselves correctly,’ says body ­alignment expert Chris James.</span></p><p><span>‘Imagine hanging a piece of string above you when you’re in a seated position — it should pass directly through the head, midway between the shoulder blades and through the centre of the pelvis to the floor.</span></p><p><span>‘Good posture allows for the free flow of blood and oxygen around the body, which forms the foundation of good health. ­Without proper alignment, the body can attract disease.’</span></p><p><span>The good news is that it’s relatively ­simple to correct poor posture — whatever your age.</span></p><p><span>Physiotherapist Cheyne Voss says the ­process of diagnosing and tackling poor posture begins at a ­muscular level. ‘People who slouch often lack sufficient support in the natural curve of their ­lumbar [lower] spine,’ he says.<br></span></p><p><span>‘As a result, the pectoral muscles of the chest are shortened while the trapezius muscle in the back becomes elongated. This puts pressure on to discs and nerves in the spine — causing pain.’</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/24/article-1349819-0CCF421B000005DC-986_196x537.jpg height=537 width=196 alt="Sandra Bullock" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/24/article-1349819-0CE0D7B2000005DC-91_196x537.jpg height=537 width=196 alt="Gwyneth Paltrow" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2011/01/24/article-1349819-0CD43ABF000005DC-751_196x537.jpg height=537 width=196 alt="Keira Knightley" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Poor posture: From left, Sandra Bullock, Gwyneth Paltrow and Keira Knightley<br></p><p><span>A McKenzie lumbar roll (£9.50; amazon.co.uk), which clips on to your chair and supports the lower back in the curve of the lower spine, can help this, maintaining a correct spinal alignment while sitting and encouraging a more upright position.</span></p><p><span>Voss advises squeezing your arms against the sides of your body to lower the ­shoulders, then contracting the core ­muscles of the stomach to add ­support to the lumbar spine.</span></p><p><span>It’s not only standing or ­sitting still that causes a ­problem. Our ‘dynamic posture’ — which occurs while we’re moving — also causes as many problems as our static posture.</span></p><p><span>Women who wear heels have a tendency to tilt their pelvis backwards, over-extending the arch at the base of the spine. Also, the so-called ‘photo pose’ that most actresses adopt (one leg in front of the other with one hand on a tilted hip and shoulders at an angle) might look good in pictures, but in reality it is forcing the body into a position that’s far from well balanced.</span></p><h3 style=font-weight:700 class=wocc>HOW TO PROMOTE GOOD POSTURE</h3><ul><li><p>Put a sign at eye level in front of your desk reminding yourself to gently squeeze your shoulders together and not to slump when you are sitting.</p></li><li><p>Smile. Positive ‘facial posture’ plays an essential part in signaling an upward lift in our mood.</p></li><li><p>Eating 200mg of oily fish twice a week will help to reduce inflammation and pain.</p></li><li><p>Stretch every so often at your desk. Place your hands behind your head, squeeze your elbows together and gently move</p><p>backwards until you feel a stretch in the tight area of your upper back.</p></li><li><p>Persist. Retraining your muscles to keep you in an upright position can seem like hard work at first, but the more you practise, the more natural it becomes.</p></li></ul><p><span>Yet while changing our physical ­position is crucial to halting the ­negative impacts of posture, experts believe it’s only one part of the battle.</span></p><p><span>Gerardo Reis, senior naturopath at London’s Alchemy Centre, believes poor posture has a closer link to our diet and weight than we realise. ‘Having poor ­posture can adversely affect many different systems in the body, including the nerves leading to the ­digestive organs,’ he says. ‘If the body’s ability to break down food is impaired, it can lead to an accumulation of toxins.</span></p><p><span>‘This may affect the thyroid, causing weight gain, bloating, hormonal ­imbalance and even the health of our skin and hair.</span></p><p><span>‘Stress causes people to hunch their shoulders. It’s a subconscious reaction to the pressure. Herbal teas including skullcap, withania and passion flower can help loosen postural tension.’</span></p><p><span>Podiatrist Margaret Dabbs believes that improving our ‘dynamic posture’ begins with our feet. ‘When walking, our weight rolls from the heel to the toe,’ she says.</span></p><p><span>‘The foot should be supported throughout this movement. Without this, our weight distribution can stray, forcing our upper body to lean backwards or forwards.’</span></p><p><span>Specialist shoes such as FitFlops</span></p><p><span>can help. They encourage the correct alignment of the knees and pelvis and</span></p><p><span>fix the natural curve of the spine into a good posture.</span></p><p><span>Frequent use of a rowing machine or repetitive exercises such as press-ups — which encourage the back to round — can worsen poor posture.</span></p><p><span>Consultant psychologist Ingrid Collins believes there’s an intrinsic link between the body’s position and our ‘psychological posture’.</span></p><p><span>‘At a cellular level, when happiness ­molecules — or endorphins — produced within the brain circulate in the blood, they send a signal to every cell that we’re happy and healthy,’ she says.</span></p><p><span>‘If we arrange ourselves physically in a positive manner with the shoulders back, the spine straight and the chest open, it informs the brain to send out more ­endorphins, ­triggering a feeling we experience as happiness.’</span></p><p><span>To tackle physical and psychological posture simultaneously, Chris James integrates yoga with Feldenkrais — a method of exercise developed by an Israeli physicist and martial arts expert during the mid-20th century.</span></p><p><span>Unlike traditional yoga or Pilates, Feldenkrais practitioners guide you through a series of subtle movements.</span></p><p><span>If all else fails, try Watsu, a water-based therapy similar to Shiatsu massage, which involves being gently swayed around a private pool.</span></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn2SbXBxaWlkkbC602aaqKipYsCtu9Scn6Kml2KwprjEm6mirJmawG64yKScZn2doq5uo8CtqqimXa68trjLZpueqKKawLS1zqdloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
