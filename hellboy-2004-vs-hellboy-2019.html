Especially, when he is a demon from the underworld. It’s okay though, he has a soft side and favors Baby Ruth candy bars.</p><p>Based on the graphic novel, <i>Hellboy: Seed of Destruction</i>, the film adaptation <i>HellBoy</i> (2004) loosely follows the same storyline of a demon baby taken into the care of Professor Bruttenholm after coming out of a dimensional portal. Named Hellboy, he becomes a special agent of the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD). Like any human being, Hellboy deals with a broken heart for a woman he loves, jealousy, slight father issues and of course saving the world from supernatural entities.&nbsp;</p><p>Played by Ron Perlman, Hellboy has a natural sarcastic and witty sense of humor and Perlman only adds to the character who inhibits the same type of character. His voice is also a nice touch The film also has the incredible Selma Blair as Liz Sherman, a pyrokinetic who becomes the one Hellboy must save. The film combines humor, action and the supernatural in a way that felt natural and entertaining to watch.&nbsp;</p><p>The film itself had good reviews with Guillermo Del Toro’s visuals adding to the witty humor and action. The sequel, <i>Hellboy II: The Golden Army, </i>was also praised with it stunning visuals in a supernatural setting. The Hellboy films became an epitome representation of the red skinned comic book character.</p><p></p><p>In 2019, Hellboy was reimagined. Originally planned as a sequel to the first two installments, the film became a reboot after Del Toro was not offered the same creative role. Subsequently, Perlman refused to reprise his role if Del Toro was not involved.&nbsp;</p><p>The film takes a deviation from the original films by cutting out characters such as Liz Sherman (Blair)&nbsp; and Abe Sapien (Doug Jones). Instead, they followed a storyline introducing the blood queen Vivienne Nimue (Milla Jovovich) who wants to plague the world as she planned in 517 A.D. It is up to the BPRD, a medium and Hellboy to save the day.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking on the role of Hellboy is <i>Stranger Things</i> actor David Harbour. There were mixed reactions as people felt that Perlman was the perfect portrayal of Hellboy. The film was received with mixed reviews with Hellboy having a more defined and furrowed brow expression to his face. Despite the film dialogue still having a witty sense of humor, critics felt the film was unnecessarily gory and tried to have a darker edge that did not deliver. Critics also felt the film created a mess of combining folklore, gruesome battles and humor.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Overall, putting the films head to head seems unfair and fan bases have a clear winner. When visualizing a red demon with samurai like hair, we all picture the same film.&nbsp;</p><p>Hellboy (2004) Vs.
