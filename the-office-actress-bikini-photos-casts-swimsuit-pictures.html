The duo grew very close in real life after bonding on set of the NBC program.</span></p><p><span>“We became best friends and I’m so thankful for it,” Angela told </span><a href=#><i><span>Insider</span></i></a> <span>in April 2019 about forming a special bond with Jenna. “We both say we didn’t expect to make such a close friendship later in life. But we’re so close and she’s one of my life anchors.”</span></p><p><span>Though they both have their own families now, they find time to hang out together whenever they can. Jenna is a mom to two kids, Harper and Weston, with her husband, </span><b>Lee Kirk</b><span>. Angela is a mom to one daughter, Isabel, whom she welcomed during her marriage to her ex-husband, </span><b>Warren Lieberstein</b><span>. The </span><i><span>Be Our Chef</span></i><span> host married her second husband, </span><b>Joshua Snyder</b><span>, in 2016 and is a stepmom to his two sons from a previous relationship.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s harder for sure,” Angela explained about balancing her social life and parenthood. “We all have kids and we’re busy, but it’s like anyone in life. There are friendships that mean so much to you that you work out ways to see each other. We’ll meet up for dinner, Jenna and I go for hikes or after we drop our kids off at school we’ll meet up and go for a walk.”</span></p><p><span>The series also had quite a few notable guest stars and supporting characters throughout its eight-year run, including </span><a href=#><b>Rashida Jones</b></a><span>,</span><b> Linda Purl</b><span> and </span><a href=#><b>Dakota Johnson</b></a><span>. Dakota, daughter of </span><a href=#><b>Don Johnson</b></a><span> and </span><a href=#><b>Melanie Griffith</b></a><span>, made a cameo during the series finale as Dakota, a new </span><span>accountant at Dunder Mifflin. She reflected on being featured in a few scenes in the show’s iconic final season during a June 2022 interview with </span><i><span>Vanity Fair</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I somehow got myself into being in the season finale of</span><i><span> The Office</span></i><span>, because I was a fan of </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>, of course,” she said. “I’m in it for, like, three minutes and I spent two weeks on that set. I was there every day, all day. But I did meet </span><b>Rainn Wilson</b><span> and now I also run into him on planes.”</span></p><p><span>Dakota has built quite an impressive resume since appearing on </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>. The </span><i><span>Bad Times at El Royale</span></i><span> actress loves unwinding by spending time down by the ocean in her best swimwear.</span></p><p><b>Keep scrolling to see ‘The Office’ cast’s bikini photos.</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46tn55ln5uzqq%2FEZpicrKKawLR5waKioqaZYr2pu9OoqmabkajBtHnSsKCmq6WewW68yJyrrqqVqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
