&#34;You should see your face.&#34; Executive accessories editor Sam Broekema is looking at me with pity in his eyes. We are in BAZAAR's storied fashion closet, the place where women's dreams live. But mine are dying. We're standing in front of a shelf filled with … flats. Which I am supposed to, in theory, put on my feet.
To say that I am a heels girl is an understatement."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Executive accessories editor Sam Broekema is looking at me with pity in his eyes. We are in BAZAAR's storied fashion closet, the place where women's dreams live. But mine are dying. We're standing in front of a shelf filled with … flats. Which I am supposed to, in theory, put on my feet.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To say that I am a heels girl is an understatement. And my deep, passionate love of heels wasn't born from trying to build up my height—I'm five foot eight, which is completely respectable in this day and age—it's just that I feel better in heels. More commanding. More leggy. More … more. Even my sneakers have wedges in them (merci bien, Isabel Marant, it's like you really get me).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, I've always admired "the gamines," as I call them, who run around town in their perfect skinny jeans and flat flats, cut with just a little toe cleavage, maybe a wee point, and mostly by Lanvin or Alaïa. Ladies like the shoe designer and stylist Tabitha Simmons, model (and sometime shoe designer) Inès de la Fressange, and style minx Alexa Chung. All girls on the go, and I mean that quite literally. I was seduced by that look for a moment a few years ago, thinking that I too could bring a little Hep-burn (Audrey, though Katharine had her brogue-ish charms) to work. As I bounced into the office—flats are helpful for that, plus movement generally—a fellow editor stopped me in surprise: "Oh! You're not that tall! I had no idea." I replied, "We shall never speak of this again."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But I had to—because I had to write this story. So the flats start tiptoeing into my office. A pair of super-pointy Marc Jacobs in a polite shade of beige, while getting immediate Instagram approval, make me feel like a witch without any magic. Givenchy's flat this season is a chunky black sandal with a giant gold buckle, which looked fantastic on the runway teamed with long, fluid skirts—but on me? Pagan pilgrim. Ivory Chanel sneakers, bedecked with camellias? "Cool!" say those born in the '90s.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Following those, a pair of glossy patent blue Diors. These I like because they conjure up dolphins, and that makes me feel free. Not to mention that they come with Raf Simons's cool stamped into the sole. These could work, I think, my mood lifting a few inches. Then, like a punk Fred Astaire, some Saint Laurent oxfords, covered in small silver studs. They're really rather jazzy (and given that my only motivation to wear flats is easy movement and danceability) and persuasive. But then—voilà! Flats designed by one of the gamines herself, Tabitha Simmons. Blue-and-white-striped with a colorful Peruvian detail, they are witty and pretty in equal measure. As I headed out of town to Utah, I decide to spirit them away to scoot around my hotel. They not only look good in the desert, but they fit beautifully and make my feet look like the sole of chic. (See what I did there?)</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So, dear Tabithas, I will have you, even though you may only be worn on national holidays, eclipses, and trips out of town. Whenever I look down, I smile—even though the ground is a lot closer than it should be.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Feeling flat? Brown's dilemma. <strong>Être Cécile</strong> T-shirt. <strong>Dior</strong> shoes.</p><img alt="this image is not available" title="this image is not available" width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Media Platforms Design Team</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaaWRohXC4wK6pmmWSp7y4uoyloJ%2BdXWV%2FcoCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
