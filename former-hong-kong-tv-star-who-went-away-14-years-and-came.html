In those days, TVB was recruiting students from our college because they had a shortage of young actors. So I was studying and professionally acting at the same time in the early 70s. This was partly because the Baptist College campus was right next to TVB’s studios in Kowloon Tong! You could finish school, walk up the road and be an actor.</p><p datatype="p" class="boldampcap e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101707639832IIE data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">How did you find the transition from acting to directing?</strong></p><p datatype="p" class="noindent e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>I was offered a job as a junior producer at TVB by Chung King-fai in 1973, right after graduation. It was a rare phenomenon then. I was sitting on the panel at the age of 23, directing television series.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 1975, TVB wanted to make a big-budget costume drama, <span id=U101707639832O3E class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>Tragedy in the Qing Emperor’s Court</span>. They were looking to cast someone as [the emperor] Guangxu, and Chung King-fai suggested me. I was reluctant at first, but he said that I had enough star power to play opposite Liza Wang Ming-chuen as the emperor’s favourite concubine, Zhen Fei. I think 2.5 million people were watching the series every night out of 3.5 million people living in Hong Kong at the time.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Mona Fong, widow of Hong Kong movie mogul Sir Run Run Shaw, dies aged 83</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I mostly quit acting after 1975, since I preferred directing. I left television in 1983, and started the first ever commercial theatre company in Hong Kong. My productions included <span id=U101707639832BsD class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>Barefoot in the Park</span>, starring Tony Leung Ka-fai and Fung Bo Bo in the lead roles. I then directed plays including the British comedy <span id=U101707639832WSF class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-3>Bedroom Farce</span>, which was invited to do a run at the Beacon Theatre on Broadway in New York. The then governor of Hong Kong, Sir Edward Youde, and his wife came to grace the opening night of our production. That was a huge deal!</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After that, I went to London for a year to learn more about professional theatre, where I was trained under the drama master Anthony Cornish. I used to wander around the West End and watch dozens and dozens of productions. I saw the world premiere of <span id=U101707639832mLB class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>Les Misérables</span> at the Barbican Theatre, and remember seeing Princess Diana in the audience! I loved it so much that I saw it three days in a row.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">When I came back, the Academy for Performing Arts (APA) hired me as the head of its directing course. I spent 3 ½ years in that job. Some of the actors in <span id=U101707639832F3F class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>Our Town</span> were my students from back then!</p><p datatype="p" class="boldampcap e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What made you move from the theatre business to local politics in the 1990s?</strong></p><p datatype="p" class="noindent e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>In the 90s, I needed a break from theatre and drama, so I moved into community service. I was appointed the executive director of the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health, and did that for three years.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Cantonese opera expert to report to American boss of Hong Kong’s West Kowloon hub</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After that, I took a year or two off travelling the world, and spent a lot of time in Europe, South America, and Southeast Asia enriching myself. Eventually I came back, and worked on Aids awareness and education campaigns for the Hong Kong government for two or three years.</p>My background in acting helped me in my politics because I was in touch with public awareness. I am good at reading people’s body language and behaviour so that was useful for me as a campaigner. I was also named one of the city’s 10 outstanding young people of 1986, along with <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Jackie Chan</span></a>.<p datatype="p" class="boldampcap e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101707639832kMD data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What’s your favourite medium to work in: television, film or radio?</strong></p><p datatype="p" class="noindent e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>I like the magic moment of live theatre because it’s irreplaceable. Real theatre is so spontaneous – you could be serious, funny, philosophical. Films that are too philosophical don’t tend to do well at the box office, and prime-time television can’t be too serious either. But with theatre, you can create magic with a bare stage. With simple movements and lighting, it can completely change your vision and imagination. For that reason I prefer theatre, especially at this stage of my life.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Old-school Cantonese opera performer looks at how to keep the art alive in Hong Kong</span></a></h4><p datatype="p" class="boldampcap e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101707639832fs data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">How has the Hong Kong entertainment industry changed since the 70s?</strong></p><p datatype="p" class="noindent e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>We worked on a shoestring budget back then. I belong to the old school. We worked very efficiently and created within time limits. We didn’t have huge casts or location shooting in the early 70s either. Nowadays, people are spoiled for choice when it comes to television drama. Local television drama is just corny now. It’s dead. There are more possibilities in theatre, I think. Hong Kong is such a cosmopolitan city, on a level with London and New York and Tokyo. But we’re not even close to the art scenes in any of those cities. We have a lot to do, a lot to catch up on.</p><p datatype="p" class="boldampcap e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U101707639832j0C data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Why did you choose to move to New Zealand, and how does it compare with Hong Kong?</strong></p><p datatype="p" class="noindent e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>We had a family tragedy in 2003, when my brother, the then assistant commissioner of police, killed himself. We were all devastated. He was very well-respected and had a lot potential. However, he decided to end his life because of depression, which he had kept a secret. We were very close, and spoke on the phone daily. I was half-dead, to be honest. I had already booked a visit to New Zealand six months before, but my parents urged me to go anyway.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I remember stepping off the plane and thinking it was heaven on earth, and decided to stay longer. I extended my visa and managed to find a job which guaranteed residency.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Going there gave me a sense of change. You breathe a different air, you see different people. Everything Hong Kong – the emotional baggage, the hang-ups – was put aside, and I’m glad I made that decision.</p><p datatype="p" class="boldampcap e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U1017076398327lD data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Why did you come back to Hong Kong after 14 years in New Zealand?</strong></p><p datatype="p" class="noindent e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>For a long time, I never ever thought of coming back to Hong Kong because my life was so completely different. But this opportunity suddenly came about last year. I stopped in Hong Kong on the way to see my sister in Vancouver, and met up with a university friend who now heads the Sunbeam Theatre. He wanted me to come back and bring world-class drama back to his theatre. I initially refused because I had such a nice life in New Zealand, but he eventually managed to convince me by giving me complete creative control. Those were terms I couldn’t refuse. I felt honoured.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><span id=U101707639832Lz class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>Our Town</span> turned out to be a huge and costly production. He knew that I could deliver.

It was great to return to it, since I know the script so well. Nobody can fool me on stage! I was so nervous during the run because understudies aren’t established here in Hong Kong, so what if my lead actor caught the flu? Thank god the actors took my advice and didn’t get ill at all! The whole run was smooth as silk.</p><p datatype="p" class="boldampcap e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" id=U10170763983208E data-qa=Component-Component><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Your new production of Our Town is dedicated to your mentor Chung King-fai. How did he influence your own work?</strong></p><p datatype="p" class="noindent e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component>He was the lecturer for all the drama courses at Baptist College. He’s a perfect gentleman, and so knowledgeable about theatre. He came back to Hong Kong after studying at Yale and decided to revolutionise the local theatre scene. He wanted to bring Western masterpieces back here, like <span id=U101707639832A7 class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>Our Town</span> and Arthur Miller’s <span id=U1017076398326hB class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-3>Death of a Salesman</span>. He is the one and only grand master of local theatre.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I’m lucky to be able to say that I was the only one of his students from Baptist College to follow him throughout his career. I went straight to work at TVB with him. He advised me when I started my own theatre company and was the artistic consultant for <span id=U101707639832fAE class="c1 css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-1>Bedroom Farce</span>.

I think you will find traces of Chung King-fai’s shadow in my production, and I’m proud of that. Maybe not as good as him, but close, I hope!</p><p datatype="p" id=U101708204789d0B class="c3 e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31" data-qa=Component-Component><span class="boldamp css-1mniedq eq9i9439" data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0>Fishball noodles, Tuscany and Cate Blanchett ...</span></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">What did you miss the most about Hong Kong while in New Zealand?</strong></p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">I live in a very small town, New Plymouth where there are hardly any Asian people, let alone Chinese.
