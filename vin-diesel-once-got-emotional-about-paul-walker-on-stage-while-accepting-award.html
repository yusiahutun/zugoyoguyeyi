The accident resulted in his body, as well as that of the driver of the vehicle, Roger Rodas, being burned beyond recognition. Paul was just 40 years old while Roger was 38. At the time, there was uncertainty as to whether Fast and Furious 7 would continue filming. Eventually, they wrapped up filming and the movie went on to win a People’s Choice <a href=#>Award</a>, where Vin took the opportunity to honor the late actor.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-vin-diesel-honored-paul-walker-in-emotional-acceptance-speech>Vin Diesel honored Paul Walker in emotional acceptance speech</h2><p>In his speech for favorite movie, Vin Diesel said: “We didn’t want to come back to filming” after Paul Walker died, and so it meant a lot to him they had been given the accolade.</p><p>“You know, as I was coming up here, I always do this. I say I’m not going to get emotional about winning these awards, and I was cool when I was sitting in my seat, and then they handed me two awards. One for favorite action <a href=#>movie</a> and one for favorite film. You all thought that this was your favorite film.</p><p>“I think of Dom and Brian and I start to think of Paul,” the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star said.</p><p>“They said to make this short and sweet so I will try to make this short and sweet,” continued the 56-year-old, “It was a labor of love. My only message to you is you’d be amazed what you can do with love. You’d be amazed at how powerful a force that is. When we didn’t want to come back to filming when the tragedy was too heavy, it was the love of everyone combined that saw us through to the end.”</p><p>“I want to thank the People’s Choice Awards. It’s real people that are voting for these awards. It’s just pure fans saying how much they appreciate our work, and that means the world to me,” he concluded.</p><p>In the years since Paul’s death, Vin has stayed in contact with his late friend’s loved ones and even walked Paul’s daughter,<strong> </strong>Meadow, down the aisle in 2021.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-vin-remembers-paul-frequently>Vin remembers Paul frequently</h2><p>Vin Diesel has in recent months taken to his <a href=#>Instagram</a> quite a few times to share memories of Paul Walker. On what would have been the <a href=#>celebrity’s</a> 50th birthday, Vin wrote, in part: “The world isn’t the same brother… as a species, one might say we are struggling. But I think of you, and I smile and know everything is going to be alright.</p><p>“I miss you… I love you, and I will continue to honor the beautiful soul you are. Happy Birthday…”</p><p>In another, he wrote about getting emotional at the 2016 awards. Sharing a snap of himself accepting the award, Vin again expressed his love for fans of the Fast and Furious franchise.</p><p>“Universal just informed me that you all nominated FastX part 1… Best Action Movie and Best Movie of the year…” he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">penned</a>, “I immediately was brought back to 2016, and that moment I was doing my best to fight back emotions and remain cool. I have had the great fortune to make many films and play many iconic characters… but when I go into that Dom state of mind, it’s as though I am simply doing a sketch… of my soul.</p><p>“You have always been there with me on this journey, your love and support fuels me beyond words.<br>I only hope to make you proud.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2aFcMLIp2SdoZWosq15zqeanmWXpMFuscyoq6Knnpa5bq3BqKytZaCWwq151pqjpJ2iYryvedKtmKCdXay1qrjEZpicm5Wlwaq6xmaYsJmimXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
