Today’s topic is also related to the same personale, <strong>Robert Hernandez</strong> who successfully established his career as a Tattoo artist. Moreover,&nbsp; he is best known for his dark-grey tattoos. Some of his Tattoo styles include medieval art, impressionism, surrealism, contemporary art, and event photography.</p><p>If you also find the tattoo profession amazing, then you would love to read about the Polish artist and his journey to become one of the best in the world.</p><h2>Childhood of Robert Hernandez</h2><p>Robert Hernandez was into drawing and painting from an early age of four. His first drawing was of <strong>Charles De Gaulle</strong>. He spent most of his teens with his grandparents who used to draw caricatures in a notebook.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Capture-2.png><p>Later, Robert attended art school, where his skill was perfectly crafted and gained lots of theoretical experiences. Apart from drawing, he is interested in music and a big fan of the American musical band, Kiss. He also started to draw images, sketch, and a comic book about the NewYork based band.</p><h2>Journey From an Amateur to Professional</h2><p>After completing high school, Robert Hernandez moved to Madrid in 1988.&nbsp; He didn’t have an easy start, and after years of struggle, he got a chance to start his career with <strong>Mao y Cathy</strong>, the owner of the first-ever tattoo studio in Madrid. Mao also worked with varieties of tattoo artists from all over Europe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Robert-Hernandez-249x300.jpg><p>During his time at Mao y Cathy, he worked countless conventions and tattoo studios around the globe. On top, he loved to travel, and until 1993, he had gained huge experience and inspiration through travels. Eventually, he also started his own tattoo studio in Madrid, Vitamin Tattoo where Robert serves as a Tattoo artist.</p><h2>Tattoo Beliefs</h2><p>Robert Hernandez has his own unique style that believes in realism. He loves to play different tones and textures on his tattoos. Besides that, his tattoos also involve distorting portraits or images. His tattoos are always alive as and subject always appears, no matter how far it has fetched the subject appears, which is unique in itself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allstarbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/10731732_737474636327808_1530007002_n-1-300x300.jpg><p>However, he has his own philosophy about tattoos and believes everything is tattooed if it can be drawn or painted. His tattoos are usually graphics and sincere and love to use pastels to achieve that style. Pastels have a unique texture, which looks like oil paints and watercolor.</p><h2>What’s His Relationship Status?</h2><p>Surfing through almost every known source, none evidence can be found regarding his love relationship. Although this tattoo artist has gained immense prominence, he has kept his love life under the wraps.</p><p>Going through his Instagram, various pictures of his work can be found but not a single picture that could hint about his current relationship status. Maybe this skillful artist is married or dating or single, but the detail isn’t confirmed.</p><h2>Net Worth – $1.5 Million</h2><p>Robert Hernandez has estimated the net worth of somewhere between <strong>$1million</strong>– <strong>$2 million</strong> which he accumulated from 25 years of career as a Tattoo artist. The wealth he gathered can be compared with the tattoo artist, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Hannah Pixie Snowdon</strong></a>. He charges from<strong> $2 thousand</strong> to <strong>$20 thousand</strong> per tattoo depending upon the type of tattoo.</p><p>The 50-year old, however, doesn’t receive a salary since he handles his own Tattoo House, Vitamin Tattoos, which is situated in the posh area of Madrid, Spain. But when estimated, he earns around <strong>$250 thousand</strong> per annum. According to the bigtattooplanet, once in a convention, he charges around $1,400 for 5 hour-long art project.&nbsp; Concerning his fees, predicting his wealth in a million will not be illogical.</p><h2>Celebrity Connections</h2><p>Robert is in tattooing business for over 25 years and is considered one of the best in the tattoo world and has also gained lots of popularity for his work. He is followed by a thousand on his Instagram account and often mail him admiring his works. This polish based tattoo artist not only has ordinary people on his fan list but he is also loved by some of the biggest celebrities.</p><p>Some of his biggest celebrity clients are members of the Kiss band which is the same band which Robert admired all his life. Apart from that David Beckham and Victoria Beckham are also other big names he has worked with.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHAta3Rm6CoZpOkunC%2Bzpucq6xdnbKzusCnm56yXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
