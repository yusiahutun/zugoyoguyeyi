When I was there, y’all were stealing my ideas and putting them in your company. Then you dismantled my creative team,” the 46-year-old claimed.</p><p>He then claimed the company made “fake colorways” and ‘paid off his lawyers’ while he was with them. “Then you dropped me, on a morality clause, even though y’all were the ones stealing my designs.”</p><p>In the final bombshell claim, the father of four says the corporation’s CEO told the singer they were going to “burn the product” directly to his face.</p><p>The rapper also took swipes via an Instagram caption, which has yet again been deleted.</p><p>“F*** Adidas and everybody who works there or with them.

No response from the Toronto-born rapper yet, but Ye has warned that if anyone else comes to his head, he’ll be back.</p><p>So expect more drama!</p><p>Check out the full rant <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.
