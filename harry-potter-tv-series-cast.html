The latest news is that casting is still underway, so no one has been confirmed to star in the series. In the meantime, read on for&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our dream&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV series cast on Max</a>.</p><p>While it’s highly likely that the studio will choose unknown child actors for the younger roles (like Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, etc.), there are a ton of talented British actors who could portray the adult characters in the series, including Severus Snape, Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, and more.</p><p>When the TV show was announced, Warner Bros. confirmed that the cast would be entirely new from the films starring Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. While speaking to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>&nbsp;in January 2024, Warner Bros. Television Chairperson Channing Dungey said that casting the kids is their next step aside from hiring a showrunner. “The tricky part is the first two books, where the kids are on the younger end, around 11 or 12,” she said.</p><p>None of the original actors from the film series are slated to return for the TV adaptation. However, Matthew Lewis, who played Neville Longbottom in all eight&nbsp;Harry Potter&nbsp;movies, said he would like to play Remus Lupin, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher and werewolf. “The character I enjoyed was Professor Lupin,” Lewis said at the&nbsp;Harry Potter&nbsp;panel at MegaCon in Orlando, Florida.</p><p>Meanwhile, Radcliffe told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>ComicBook.com</a>, “My understanding is that they’re trying to very much start fresh and I’m sure whoever is making them will want to make their own mark on it and probably not want to have to figure out how to get old Harry to cameo in this somewhere.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=the-harry-potter-tv-series-dream-cast>The Harry Potter TV series dream cast</h2><p>From Adam Driver as Snape to Nick Frost as Hagrid, check out&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">our dream&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Potter&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV series cast</a>&nbsp;below (which includes upcoming British child stars who could play the well-known trio).</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.4585921325052><h2><strong>Toby Woolf</strong> as <strong>Harry Potter</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/1.-Toby-Woolf.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>Rare Beasts, Pistol, The Last Post, On The Beaches<br><strong>Why Toby Woolf: </strong>Although it’s difficult to picture anyone other than Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, child star Toby Woolf is reportedly in the running for the lead role. The latest update from Warner Bros. is that casting is still underway, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>, so the studio could also pick three unknown child actors to portray the iconic trio.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2><strong>Joshua Pickering as Ronald Weasley</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2.-Ron-Weasley-Joshua-Pickering.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>Peter Pan & Wendy, A Discovery of Witches, Safe Space<br><strong>Why Joshua Pickering: </strong>The young British actor recently starred as John Darling in Disney’s 2023 film Peter Pan & Wendy. Potterheads are already picturing Joshua as the new Ronald Weasley. Plus, he already has experience working on adventure and magical-like projects. But as we said above, there’s a chance Max could choose a younger, lesser-known actor for this role.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2.5><h2>Keira Chansa as Hermione Granger</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Keira-Chansa-as-Hermione-Granger.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>Come Away, Silverpoint Season 2, Small Island, The Wheel of Time<br><strong>Why Keira Chansa: </strong>Eleven-year-old<strong> </strong>rising star Keira Chansa would be a fantastic pick for Hermione Granger, portrayed by Emma Watson in the films. In 2016, South African actress Noma Dumezweni was cast as the Muggle-born witch in the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child play, so there’s a strong possibility Warner Bros. will choose a young Black actress for this role in the reboot (as they should!).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2><strong>Adam Driver as Severus Snape</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Adam-Driver-as-Severus-Snape-.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>Star Wars sequel trilogy, Paterson, Marriage Story, BlacKkKlansman, Annette, Silence, What If<br><strong>Why Adam Driver: </strong>Adam Driver is not British, so that could automatically exclude him from the running (if Warner Bros. decides to stick with an all-UK cast like in the films). But Driver is undoubtedly the biggest fan pick for this role and has been for years. With his lean stature, slick black hair, and long nose, he resembles Alan Rickman’s character to a tee.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4><h2><strong>Jared Harris as Albus Dumbledore</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Jared-Harris-as-Albus-Dumbledore.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>Sherlock Holmes 2, Sherlock Holmes 3, Chernobyl, Foundation, Morbius, The Terror<br><strong>Why Jared Harris: </strong>Jared Harris’ late father, Richard Harris, played Hogwarts’ oldest and wisest wizard in the first two Harry Potter films before his death. Harris reportedly was in the running to play the younger version of the character in the Fantastic Beasts films, but the role went to Jude Law. Seeing Jared grow into this role would mark a beautiful, full-circle moment for the franchise.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=2><h2><strong>Cillian Murphy as Lord Voldemort</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Cillian-Murphy-as-Lord-Voldemort.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>Peaky Blinders, Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place Part II, The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, Dunkirk<br><strong>Why Cillian Murphy: </strong>Cillian Murphy would be brilliant playing he-who-must-not-be-named. The Irish actor has a record of chilling roles like the psychopathic scarecrow in the Dark Knight trilogy. We’re confident that he can embody the dark wizard (especially with a skilled makeup team to help him pull off the eerie transformation).</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2><strong><strong>Nick Frost</strong></strong> <strong>as Rubeus Hagrid</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Nick-Frost-as-Rubeus-Hagrid.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>Hot Fuzz, Shaun of the Dead, The World’s End, Paul, Spaced, Truth Seekers<br><strong>Why Nick Frost: </strong>Nick Frost may be shorter than the late Robbie Coltrane, but the British comedian has garnered massive fan support to play the Hogwarts gamekeeper. Given Frost’s comedic timing and acting experience, he could easily replicate Hagrid’s beloved accent and gentle kindness.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3><h2><strong>Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Draco Malfoy</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Benjamin-Evan-Ainsworth-as-Draco-Malfoy-.png><p><strong>Credits:</strong> Pinnochio, Son of a Critch, All Fun and Games, The Haunting of Bly Manor<br><strong>Why Benjamin Evan Ainsworth: </strong>Like Harry, Ron, and Hermione, we think Max will go with an unknown child actor who can grow into the series as Draco. But if they wanted to cast slightly older, 15-year-old Benjamin Evan Ainsworth could be a good pick; he was recently in Disney’s 2022 film Pinnochio.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1.5><h2><strong>Tristan Ruggeri as Neville Longbottom</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Tristan-Ruggeri-as-Neville-Longbottom.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>The Witcher, The Twin, Bodies<br><strong>Why Tristan Ruggeri: </strong>Eleven-year-old Tristan Ruggeri is young enough to be cast as Neville Longbottom in the Harry Potter Max TV reboot. The child star, who has experience acting in The Witcher, could portray the clumsy and shy young wizard who grows self-confidence throughout the series.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=4.5><h2><strong>Helen Mirren</strong> as <strong>Minerva McGonagall</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Helen-Mirren-as-Minerva-McGonagall.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>The Queen, 1923, Golda, Woman in Gold, Prime Suspect, Eye in the Sky, Hitchcock<br><strong>Why Helen Mirren: </strong>At this point, Helen Mirren is British royalty, and the veteran English actress would make an excellent casting choice for the Transfiguration professor. Mirren is also a fan of the movies—in 2021, she hosted the Harry Potter: Hogwarts Tournament of Houses, a four-episode quiz show in honor of the 20th anniversary of the film series.</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=3.4393414211438><h2><strong>Ben Barnes as Sirius Black</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ben-Barnes-as-Sirius-Black-.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>Narnia film series, The Punisher, Shadow and Bone<br><strong>Why Ben Barnes: </strong>Harry Potter fans really want Ben Barnes to play Sirius Black in the reboot. In a <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Reddit Q&A</a> with the actor, a fan asked, “Have you, at any point in your life, read fanfiction about a certain long haired, convicted murderer that turns into a dog at will and his friend group whilst they were at school?” in reference to the Marauders. Barnes replied, “haha no but i know what you’re referencing!! #gryffindor”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=1><h2><strong>Dev Patel as Remus Lupin</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Dev-Patel-as-Remus-Lupin.png><p><strong>Credits: </strong>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, Lion, The Personal History of David Copperfield.<br><strong>Why Dev Patel: </strong>Dev Patel is a fantastic choice for Remus Lipin. Lupin is compassionate and intelligent, and we think Dev Patel is a thoughtful performer who could live up to Remus’ legacy as one of the Marauders.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57y6Kqratfna6zvthmp6ispJq%2FbsDVZqqeqpmawG6vwKyraA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
