But even so, if Casey truly is expecting, it would be shocking news to say the least.</p><h3>Casey Anthony’s Trial Style: See Her Looks From 2011</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>“Casey knows there will be an onslaught of attention and pubic outcry once people find out that’s pregnant,” the mag’s insider dished. “But she doesn’t care.” That’s not all that’s happening in Casey’s new private life though. The brunette is apparently also engaged — and she and her alleged baby daddy are planning on tying the knot later this year! “She has been seeing the guy for about five months,” the source said. “He’s just an ordinary good-looking guy who happened to fall in love with her.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>The source continued, “He has a normal job in construction business and wants the same things in life as Casey. Her friends think he’s good for her and will be a good dad.” But seeing Casey happy is likely the last thing the public wants. “The thought of Casey having another child and living a happy life enrages many Americans,” the insider added. “She’s been marked by some as the brutal killer of her own daughter. Someone like her doesn’t deserve a do-over.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Even creepier, Casey apparently is hoping for another baby girl! “It’s still too early to find out the gender, but Casey really wants as daughter,” the insider said. “Despite what happened to Caylee, Casey thinks she’s better equipped to raise a girl because she understands them better.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Tell us, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong> — do you think Casey deserves another chance at happiness?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH11e49uZpyZo5rGbq3NrZ%2Bopqlir6Ku2Ganq52Xo66vwIyepaCZl5qxbq%2FAsqOenV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
