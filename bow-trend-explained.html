The caption read “this is me if u even care,” and my friend’s text read: “This is so you.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A couple of days later, I sent a similar text to another friend, except there was no pickle, but instead a big black Lab insisting on eating the pink ribbon tied to her head, as “Let the Light In” by Lana Del Rey played softly. My friend is stubborn and beautiful like that dog, and so I let her know: “This is so you.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That’s how I can sum up the majority of my social interactions over the last couple of days. I’ve sent and received at least 30 similar videos of corn dogs, ice cubes, more dogs and some deer, Zithromax pill bottles, 20-pound weights, letters of resignation, tamales, shallots, and bottles of Tito’s vodka tied with bows, while Lana coos dolefully in the background. These kinds of videos have amassed hundreds of millions of views and likes. They’ve reminded me of specific girls in my life and inspired me to text them about it. They’ve made me tie a ribbon around my boyfriend’s water bottle, just so I could hold it up to him and say, “Wait, do you get it?” They’ve somehow turned the tethering of fabric into a dialect that could never be translated, a secret handshake you didn’t realize you knew.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But why?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Well, it isn’t the most unexpected internet phenomenon. It has, after all, been the year of the ribbon. With tiny schoolgirl skirts, pearl-embellished everything, and square-toe pointe ballet flats, brands like Miu Miu, Simone Rocha, and Sandy Liang found a way to bottle and sell girlhood to eager fashion fans, all tied up in a nice bow—a constant motif seen in all of their most recent collections. Miu Miu adorned its almost-always-sold-out satin ballet flats with bows. At Simone Rocha, models wore ribbons glued to the undersides of their eyes and tied into their long dangling pearl earrings. At Sandy Liang, bows were supersized into large bags, with drooping fabric falling at the shoulder.</p><img alt="a person wearing a black dress" title="a person wearing a black dress" width=2240 height=3360 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/00019-sandy-liang-spring-2024-ready-to-wear-credit-filippo-fior-gorunway-com-6584b3fdb556a.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy of Sandy Liang</span><p>A model at Sandy Liang’s Spring 2024 show with a huge bow-turned-bag</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On TikTok, these three brands have become a holy trinity of sorts for millennials and Gen Z. In #fashiontok doctrine, the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are diaphanous and dainty in a not-a-girl-not-yet-a-woman kind of way. If you scroll through the thousands of comments on the ribbon videos, you’ll find their names mentioned everywhere. On the first video I saw from the “ribbons tied to random objects” trend, a comment read: “This is so Sandy Liang–Miu Miu–Simone Rocha coded.”</p><img alt="london, england february 18 a model walks the runway during the simone rocha ready to wear fallwinter 2023 2024 fashion show as part of the london fashion week on february 18, 2023 in london, united kingdom photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Simone Rocha - Runway - Fall/Winter 2023-2024" width=2833 height=4256 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1467441057-6584a7bd60d05.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><p>A model at Simone Rocha’s Fall 2023 show with ribbons attached under the eyes and a matching pair of drop earrings</p><img alt="paris, france march 08 a model walks the runway during the miu miu ready to wear fallwinter 2022 2023 fashion show as part of the paris fashion week on march 8, 2022 in paris, france photo by victor virgilegamma rapho via getty images" title="Miu Miu - Runway - Fall/Winter 2022-2023 Paris Fashion Week" width=2670 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1383092993-6584adbde5a4c.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Victor Virgile</span><p>The popular Miu Miu ballet flat, reenvisioned as a heel, with a bow detail on the tip</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The obsession with bows feels like a side effect of how women, in large part, have recently embraced the hyperfeminine. 2023 was meant to be the year of the recession, but instead it was the year of Taylor Swift’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a45524614/taylor-swift-eras-tour-movie-review/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Eras Tour" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Eras Tour</a>, Beyoncé’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a46285838/destinys-child-reunite-backstage-photo-renaissance-tour/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Renaissance Tour" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Renaissance Tour</a>, and the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a44617536/barbie-ending-explained/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Barbie class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Barbie</a> movie, generating billions of dollars and boosting the economy effectively through the spending power of women. It’s also now been over a full year since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. With women’s bodily autonomy up for constant debate, it’s not exactly a “girl power” era. And dressing like it is won’t necessarily will one into existence. But it does feel like an act of defiance and pride, as though to say, “I’m a woman, goddammit! And I’ll wear a pretty pink bow if I want.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There’s also, of course, the undeniable infantilization of wearing a ribbon in your hair or pinned to your Peter Pan collar. It’s the kind of aesthetic associated with fleeting girlhood, of a time when you didn’t know your gender could be weaponized against you. And youth, in general, is trending in a big way amongst zoomers, who will tell a 25-year-old they look good for their age and brag about the benefits of starting preventative Botox in college. On TikTok, middle schoolers have gone viral for 12-step skincare videos, where they preach the benefits of anti-wrinkle cream. Younger millennials and Gen Zers lost three years of their normal, precedented youth, to Covid. Ribbons are like a quick fix, something you can tie on to try to make up for lost time, something that screams, “I’M STILL YOUNG!!!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A couple of days ago, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://x.com/chloeikennedy/status/1736469980605038954?s=46&t=-7GanDQXATTmWpUBp8bdBQ" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a viral tweet" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">a viral tweet</a> featured the clip from Uptown Girls in which Brittany Murphy’s character, Molly, and the child she’s nannying are spinning ’round on Coney Island’s teacups ride. It read: “grown women participating in a trend to seek a perpetual state of girlhood… preteen girls asking for retinol cream for christmas…”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It made me re-watch the film, and within the first few minutes was a scene I had forgotten entirely about. At Molly’s 22nd birthday party, one of her friends tells her she can get Botox to fix her worry wrinkle. Panicking about that in a women’s room mirror, Murphy abruptly sees an old lady in place of her reflection, before a small voice calls out from a stall: “I had shoes like yours once—when I was five.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The child is talking about Murphy’s girlish heels, each topped with a large sequined star. This movie came out in 2003—two decades ago!—and yet we are still there, pressing our faces against mirrors, looking for imperfections, and being told we need to buy some glitzy heel or skirt or bow that can maybe help reverse time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes, the bow can be seen as a symbol of women trying to cling to our youth as it has been marketed to us, but perhaps it’s also representative of how collectively stunted and stagnant we are. We don’t want to grow up, and we haven’t grown up. We’re all in that spinning teacup ride, watching time pass us by, while we stay exactly as were.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It can also be seen as the waving of a white flag. With the rise of the bow trend came the resurgence of the phrase “I’m just a girl.” It’s been used to caption these ribbon videos, and to justify unnecessary purchases and just about anything and everything else, like <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8HTycNC/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="leaving a car running" data-vars-ga-product-id=7e6471d3-d7f3-4563-ae37-18ca9371992f data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8HTycNC/ data-product-url=https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8HTycNC/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2Ft%2FZT8HTycNC%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=6cb8c186-9f3d-420f-a46e-b841484aab13 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">leaving a car running</a> for an entire school day or <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8HTFs6g/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="grabbing only makeup" data-vars-ga-product-id=307a8f85-a617-40d6-9e14-86b81652c07f data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8HTFs6g/ data-product-url=https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8HTFs6g/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2Ft%2FZT8HTFs6g%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=89a4bffa-0adf-4603-ab22-c5486e9d5715 class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">grabbing only makeup</a> when the house is on fire.

And ironically, they’ve used No Doubt’s <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHzOOQfhPFg" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“Just A Girl”" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">“Just A Girl”</a> as the soundtrack. But maybe they didn’t really read the lyrics:</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Take this pink ribbon off my eyes<br>I’m exposed, and it’s no big surprise<br>Don’t you think I know exactly where I stand?<br>This world is forcing me to hold your hand</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">’Cause I’m just a girl<br>Oh, little old me<br>Well, don’t let me out of your sight<br>Oh, I’m just a girl<br>All pretty and petite<br>So don’t let me have any rights</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Or maybe they just didn’t want to. Once videos dissecting the ribbon trend went as viral as the videos themselves, people got defensive and said things like, “Why can’t girls just enjoy things?” and “Nah, I just like ribbons.” But I’m still sitting here, with a Sandy Liang bow pinned to the back of my hair, as I look up at the large pink bow I’ve hung on my Christmas garland, very much enjoying it, trying to grapple with what it all means.</p><img alt="london, england september 17 alexa chung is seen wearing brown mini skirt, coat outside simone rocha during london fashion week september 2023 on september 17, 2023 in london, england photo by christian vieriggetty images" title="Street Style - LFW September 2023" width=3877 height=5575 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1687190157-6584b224eb9f7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Christian Vierig</span><p>Presenter and model Alexa Chung outside of Simone Rocha’s most recent runway show, wearing a bow top by the designer</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One friend told me she thought ribbons were actually sort of democratic. You can buy some cheap ribbon, tie it in your hair or on your bag, and achieve that high-fashion “Miu Miu/Simone Rocha/Sandy-Liang core” look without spending more than $5. Another told me she liked how, now, if you step outside of the house with a bow or a ribbon somewhere on your outfit, you’ll get a handful of nods and smiles from girls you don’t know on the street. There is a sense of community.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But just like the pussy hat didn’t save us in 2017, ribbons aren’t going to in 2023 or 2024. Even if some of us have a hard time admitting it, each of us is more than “just a girl,” and ribbons are more than just ribbons. And I’m more than just a girl who likes ribbons, and yeah … this is me if u even care.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
