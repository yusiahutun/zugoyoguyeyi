In fact, the then-22-year-old was having trouble finding work and desperately needed money. She had been released from contracts with both 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures, and turned back to modeling to make ends meet.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>That's how she was convinced by photographer Tom Kelley to pose nude. With Mr. Kelley's wife, Natalie, present to calm her nerves, Marilyn laid against a red velvet backdrop while nearly naked, staring sensuously into the camera.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>For the shoot, Marilyn made a paltry $50 - and signed the release as 'Mona Monroe' to protect herself - and also because she was embarrassed and ashamed.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In the book&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Marilyn: Her Life in Her Own Words</a>, Marilyn herself explained that she only agreed to Mr. Kelley's request out of 'desperation', as she believed 'nice girls did not pose in the nude'.</span></p><h2>RELATED ARTICLES</h2><ul class="rotator-pages link-xocc"><li class=rotator-prev><a href=# data-page=prev>Previous</a></li><li><a href=# data-page=1>1</a></li><li class=rotator-next><a href=# data-page=next>Next</a></li></ul><ul class="rotator-panels link-bogr1 linkro-ccox"><li><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/13/21/2C47ABA800000578-0-image-m-119_1442175975138.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>Kylie Jenner narrowly avoids a Marilyn moment</span></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/09/15/00/2C51699100000578-0-image-m-138_1442272451666.jpg width=62 height=60 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <span>How Tinseltown's finest only ever buy homes from their...</span></a></li></ul><h2>Share this article</h2><span class=wai>Share</span> <img id=i-b3aacc68124af84c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/28/20/2AE9FE3F00000578-3177815-image-a-30_1438113531511.jpg height=863 width=634 alt="Creative cover-up: Other photos of Marilyn wearing a bit more clothing were produced for versions of the 1951 Golden Dreams calendar, because it was illegal to send nude photos through the mail" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Creative cover-up: Other photos of Marilyn wearing a bit more clothing were produced for versions of the 1951 Golden Dreams calendar, because it was illegal to send nude photos through the mail</p><img id=i-6402efe093e58600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/28/21/2AEA104C00000578-3177815-image-m-42_1438113692924.jpg height=783 width=634 alt="Getting paid: Desperate for money, the actress posed for photographer Tom Kelley to make ends meet - and earned $50 for the shoot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Getting paid: Desperate for money, the actress posed for photographer Tom Kelley to make ends meet - and earned $50 for the shoot</p><img id=i-bc7785008500edfa src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/28/21/2AE9FE7800000578-3177815-image-m-43_1438113707074.jpg height=797 width=634 alt="It's a secret: Marilyn asked Mr. Kelly to promise that she would be unrecognizable in the photos, and even signed the release using the name Mona Monroe" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>It's a secret: Marilyn asked Mr. Kelly to promise that she would be unrecognizable in the photos, and even signed the release using the name Mona Monroe</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'You must promise to never tell anyone about my posing for you in the nude,' she reportedly told him.

The printer even had to create additional versions of the picture, as at the time it was illegal to send a nude photo in the mail - which explains why there are nearly identical shots in which Marilyn is seen in a bra and a lace teddy.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>However, by that time, Marilyn was beginning to get more work as an actress again. She had appeared in the hit film All About Eve alongside Bette Davis, as well as a number of other motion pictures.

With scandal brewing, Marilyn - who had recently signed a new seven-year contract with 20th Century - was urged by the company to deny that the photos were of her and told they would ruin her career.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Instead, though, the actress decided to tell the truth, explaining in an interview that she had been poor and struggling at the time. And instead of turning on her, the public sympathized.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In fact, her star rose even higher. In December of 1953, Hugh Hefner licensed the photo for $500 to appear on the cover of the first ever issue of Playboy, which sold 50,000 copies.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But while the sultry photograph has become iconic, the original color separations were long thought to be lost. Color separations are used to ensure that the precise hues that are present in a photograph are represented in the final print.</span></p><img id=i-d629f3f874f1e251 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/28/21/2AEA890400000578-3177815-image-a-49_1438116151021.jpg height=793 width=634 alt="See the star: Other photos of Marilyn will also appear in the&nbsp;LimitedRuns exhibition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>See the star: Other photos of Marilyn will also appear in the&nbsp;LimitedRuns exhibition</p><img id=i-a8119529589e9878 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/28/21/2AEA864D00000578-3177815-image-a-50_1438116205354.jpg height=793 width=634 alt="Diamonds are a girl's best friend: The other pictures are not from her nude shoot; some of from her film sets, like this one from Gentleman Prefer Blondes" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Diamonds are a girl's best friend: The other pictures are not from her nude shoot; some of from her film sets, like this one from Gentleman Prefer Blondes</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>In the case of this particular photo, 'touch plates' were used to add additional layers, including clothes and pasties that were laid over the original photograph.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Touch plates were also used to achieve the exact shade of red on Marilyn's lips and the correct shade of golden hair.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>But it wan't until 2009 that these color separations were found again, still in the files of the printing company that produced the Golden Dreams calendar.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Now they are touring the country with LimitedRuns as part of the Red Velvet Summer 2015 Tour, along with other photos of the star including snaps of her with writer and poet Carl Sandburg.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>They have already been on display Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, and are set to stop in Chicago and New York before the end of September.</span></p><img id=i-90ab94f22b919e10 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/28/21/2AEA864900000578-3177815-image-a-51_1438116220586.jpg height=817 width=634 alt="Superstar stunner: Marilyn continued to grow more famous after the nude scandal, and the picture eventually appeared on the first cover of Playboy" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Superstar stunner: Marilyn continued to grow more famous after the nude scandal, and the picture eventually appeared on the first cover of Playboy</p><img id=i-59b3a39fbf869644 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/07/28/21/2AEA865400000578-3177815-image-a-52_1438116339071.jpg height=807 width=634 alt="Pay day: While Marilyn made just $50 for the nude photos, the photographer sold them for $900" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Pay day: While Marilyn made just $50 for the nude photos, the photographer sold them for $900</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6aqa2hk6Gybn%2BRbGxsb2Nkn6K%2BxGaqraGcocBumcCroKWxnmKasLrRqJxmq12esLC6yJxkp62UmnqkrcuepZ2ZomLAqbvOrWRqcWVlwG6%2BxK%2BcmqSVmXq4u9Gtn2ZuXYKWjZioiIVnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
