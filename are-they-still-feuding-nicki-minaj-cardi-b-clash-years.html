This has led to constant comparisons between both women who are leading figures in the world of female rap.</strong></p><p>It’s been over three years since Nicki Minaj called for an end to the media frenzy surrounding her and Cardi B’s feud following their physical altercation during the New York Fashion Week.</p><p>It’s also been three years since Cardi B agreed to call it a truce via her ten-word reply to Nicki’s post. Yet, it’s just impossible to act like their 2018 altercation never happened.</p><p>Notwithstanding, both rap queens seem to have moved on from their <a href=#>rivalry</a>, managing to respect each other’s space while conquering the female rap genre in their own rights.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=there-is-enough-room-for-two-queens><span class=ez-toc-section id=There_is_Enough_Room_For_Two_Queens></span><strong>There is Enough Room For Two Queens</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Cardi B experienced a dramatic rise to fame and fortune since her days of “Bodak Yellow,” even snagging a win at the Grammy 2021 award show. She landed that win alongside Meghan Thee Stallion with whom she collaborated for their “WAP” performance.</p><p>Nicki hasn’t fared so bad either. In addition to acing her motherhood game following her son’s birth in 2020, she has released several groundbreaking hits and succeeded in the business world.</p><p>Among her numerous achievements was her collaboration with rapper Lil Baby in 2022 to release the track, “Do We Have A Problem.” The song topped the New Music poll as fans’ favorite within hours of its release.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>While commendable, Nicki Minaj and Cardi B’s impressive feats have only served to heighten the comparison between them. Despite their determination to uphold their truce, nothing would erase speculations of bad blood like another music collaboration between the two rap queens.</p><p>With none forthcoming, one can’t help but wonder if the duo has truly moved past their clash, or were still feuding despite realizing over time that the rap world certainly has enough room for two queens.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=the-origin-of-their-feud><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Origin_of_Their_Feud></span><strong>The Origin of Their Feud</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Cardi B first came into the music scenes in 2015. Within two years she began making waves in the female rap scenes previously dominated solely by Nicki Minaj.</p><p>Before long, many began pointing out the similarities in their rapping style, fashion choices, and even appearances. Some netizens took it a notch further in March 2017, releasing screenshots of Nicki supposedly liking an Instagram post that dissed Cardi’s rap style.</p><p>Another series of screenshots surfaced shortly after, this time showing Nicki liking a tweet that claimed the initial screenshots were fake, and possibly photoshopped.</p><p>Notwithstanding what the truth might have been, that exchange showed just how heated things could get between the duo if the world saw them as competitors.</p><p>Things became more heated in May 2021, following the release of Katy Perry’s song “Swish Swish,” ft Nicki. Many speculated that the rapper took a jab at Cardi’s husband Offset with her lines, “My life is a movie/I’m never off set / Me and my amigos (no, not offset).”</p><p>Amid the prevailing speculations, Cardi took to Instagram Live to supposedly address the incident. She ranted about idols becoming rivals and how much she hated such occurrences. Many were quick to fit the pieces about exactly which idol she was referring to.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=the-pair-dispel-rumors-of-ongoing-feuds><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Pair_Dispel_Rumors_Of_Ongoing_Feuds></span><strong>The Pair Dispel Rumors Of Ongoing Feuds</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As the media continued to pelt Nicki Minaj and Cardi B against each other, the latter was forced to speak out. She shared a post on Twitter in June that year, reminding the world not to compare her to any other artist.</p><p>That same month, a video of Nicki dancing in a club to Cardi B’s hit song “Bodak Yellow,” went viral. Many believed it was the 39-year old’s way of showing her support to the younger woman.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>However, the relief the video brought was short-lived as the supposed diss prevailed. Specifically, Nicki’s lyrics in the song, “No Flag” featuring the line, “I heard these labels are trying to make another me.”</p><p>Ultimately, many assumed those lines were another jab at Cardi, who coincidentally clinched a deal with Atlantic Records around that time. Notably, the “Anaconda” crooner cleared the air, saying she wrote the lyrics long before Cardi signed with Atlantic record.</p><p>That same month, Cardi revealed she had no interest in <a href=#>industry beef</a>, but simply wanted to make music and make money.</p><p>Barely a month later, “Bodak Yellow” hit number one, making her the first female rapper since Lauryn Hill to achieve that feat. Nicki was among a host of celebrities to congratulate Cardi on the record-breaking feat.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Congratulations to a fellow NEW YAWKA on a RECORD BREAKING achievement. Bardi, this is the only thing that matters!!! Enjoy it💕💞🎀 <a href=#>@iamcardib</a></p>— Nicki Minaj (@NICKIMINAJ) <a href=#>September 25, 2017</a></figure><p>In response, the 29-year-old admitted those words of commendation meant a lot coming from Nicki Minaj.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=working-together-on-motorsport><span class=ez-toc-section id=Working_Together_On_%E2%80%9CMotorsport%E2%80%9D></span><strong>Working Together On “Motorsport”</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Just when one could almost dream of the two becoming besties, “MotorSport” happened. The 2017 song represented the first time Nicki Minaj and Cardi B <a href=#>featured in the same song</a>.</p><p>The track, which they did alongside Offset’s band Migos, further heightened the tension between the two women. Netizens were quick to conclude Nicki had an issue with Cardi’s appearance in the song.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The Queen of Rap came forward to debunk those claims in a series of tweets. However, the “Up” singer sang a different tune in a later interview, implying Nicki in fact altered parts of her lyrics to avoid saying her name.</p><p>Meanwhile, the “Moments For Life” crooner took to social media to say they changed the lines only because Cardi and her record label insisted. She also granted an interview where she admitted how much Cardi’s claims hurt her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=nicki-minaj-and-cardi-b-meet-at-the-met-gala><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nicki_Minaj_And_Cardi_B_Meet_At_The_Met_Gala></span><strong>Nicki Minaj And Cardi B Meet At The Met Gala</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In May 2018, the two women ran into each other on the red carpet at the Met Gala. All eyes were on them in hopes of catching a hint of their hate.</p><p>However, the duo did the opposite of what the world expected, sharing a cordial embrace and pleasant chit chats. While their discussions obviously went inaudible, Nicki gave some pointers during her appearance on Howard Stern’s Sirius XM show.</p><p>She <a href=#>claimed</a> they stopped to discuss some of their misunderstandings. That August, Nicki denied ever knowing of any existing issues with Cardi B even though the songstress may have taken issues with things she said.</p><p>Perhaps that interview did not sit well with Cardi, who went on Twitter to rant about an unknown woman blocking her on all social media platforms. Trust fans to conduct a follow-up interview, which proved Nicki as the unknown woman.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Imagine subbing me but you blocked me from all social media 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣</p>— Cardi B (@iamcardib) <a href=#>August 29, 2018</a></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=the-rivalry-turns-physical><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Rivalry_Turns_Physical></span><strong>The Rivalry Turns Physical</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>After months of speculations, all hell finally broke loose during the New York Fashion Week. The two women attended the Harper’s Bazaar’s ICONS party on September 7 that year, where they got into a physical altercation.</p><p>Sources reported that Cardi B came at Nicki on the second-floor balcony during a Christina Aguilera performance. According to sources, when the rap Queen’s bodyguards prevented her from getting through, she proceeded to throw her shoes at her rival.</p><p>Throughout the <a href=#>attack</a>, Cardi reportedly kept hauling profanities at Nicki, while accusing her of talking bad about her then 8-week-old daughter, Kulture Kiari.</p><p>Nicki remained calm throughout the alteration. Eventually, security escorted Cardi B out of the venue, looking disheveled, with a swollen face and no shoes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=breaking-point><span class=ez-toc-section id=Breaking_Point></span><strong>Breaking Point</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Following their altercation, Cardi shared a post on Instagram, confronting an unnamed woman who had been sneak-dissing her all along. She claimed the person tried previously to sabotage her career and even threatened other artists who tried working with her.</p><p>Although she let it all slide in the past, having the person mention her daughter and question her capabilities as a mother was the last straw. She concluded the post by saying she’d worked too hard to let anyone mess with her success.</p><p>Again, no names were mentioned, but sure enough, everyone guessed the identity of the supposed villain Cardi referred to.</p><p>Nicki did not directly address their fight or Cardi’s post. However, she shared a video of herself rapping the lyrics of her song, “Hard White.”</p><p>Again, fans considered those lyrics a subtle shade at Cardi, who has been open about her past as a stripper. Who would blame them when those lines coincidentally talked about poles and stripping.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=nicki-calls-for-a-truce><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nicki_Calls_For_A_Truce></span><strong>Nicki Calls For A Truce</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>One month after the two women got physical, Nicki Minaj took to Twitter to issue her version of a “cease and desist” order.</p><p>Via the tweet, she <a href=#>urged</a> everyone to focus on positive things thereon, as she would no longer address “this nonsense,” no matter how entertaining people found it.</p><p>Cardi B seemed to agree with her on this one. She took to Instagram to sign the truce with the words, “@Nickiminaj alright then! Let’s keep it positive and keep it pushing.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ok you guys, let’s focus on positive things only from here on out. We’re all so blessed. I know this stuff is entertaining & funny to a lot of people but I won’t be discussing this nonsense anymore. Thank you for the support & encouragement year after year. Love you. ♥️</p>— Nicki Minaj (@NICKIMINAJ) <a href=#>October 30, 2018</a></figure><p>Those ten words seemed to do the trick for the two women, who have remained worlds apart in the last few years. One could safely assume they have long put their feuding past behind them. Have they though?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=reopening-old-wounds><span class=ez-toc-section id=Reopening_Old_Wounds></span><strong>Reopening Old Wounds</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In December 2021, after a long silence, a Twitter user claimed the songstress was under fire after fans discovered she still followed accounts that dissed Nicki Minaj years after their feud.</p><p>Cardi B did not take likely to those speculations, attempting to clear her name via Twitter. She said she saw nothing wrong with following her fans, and whoever they chose to like or condemn had nothing to do with her.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cardi B says she just wants to interact with her fans on Instagram without scrutiny after Nicki Minaj fans question who @/_unofficial_brand is. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fX3ugdKLyT</a></p>— DFG  (@dramaforthegirl) <a href=#>December 12, 2021</a></figure><p>She also implored netizens to stop linking her to such cases. Several netizens defended the mother of two for stepping forward to clear the rumors in her now-deleted tweets.</p><p>Others however accused the songstress of manipulating her feud with Nicki as an attention-seeking stunt.</p><p>Notwithstanding, Cardi addressed the issue no further after stating her piece and encouraging the world to look forward to the exciting things she had coming in the New Year and beyond. Fingers crossed!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51krrOxjK2fnrFdqMGquMtmnZ6tlJ67qHnNopqkoV2itq%2BtyWaamqqUnnqjecKlmKygXa6yor7SaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
