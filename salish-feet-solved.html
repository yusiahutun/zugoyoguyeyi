Most of them have been intact and half have been identified. However, citizens of the area have been perplexed by <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/culture/1743543/daphne-abdela-now/>the recent phenomenon</a>.</p><p>Here’s an explanation of why the Salish Sea had a lot of foot discoveries and the theories that have come up in the past.</p><ul class="pmc-fallback-list-items lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-margin-t-2"><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=9.8936170212766><h2>Was the Salish Feet mystery solved?</h2><p>Technically yes, there have been scientific explanations as to why the feet and shoes were found on the Salish Sea. However, each motive for why they were found varies.</p><p>“Feet easily disarticulate and when they are attached to a flotation device such as a running shoe, they are easily washed ashore,” wrote Gail Anderson, co-director of the Center for Forensic Research at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, in an <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/12/18/16777724/human-feet-beach-pacific-northwest-seattle-vancouver rel=nofollow>email to Vox.</a> “Notice there are no feet washing ashore in stiletto heels or flip-flops. Also, today’s running shoes are much more buoyant than in the past.” As to why they haven’t been eaten by sea creatures, “[A]rthropods will skeletonize and disarticulate a body quite quickly depending on oceanic conditions.”</p><p>“Things that float at the ocean surface move with the currents, but also are pushed a bit by the wind, and this can be significant in getting them to shore,” &nbsp;Parker MacCready, an oceanography professor at the University of Washington wrote in an email to the outlet. “The prevailing winds here [around the Salish Sea] are west to east, and so floating stuff in this part of the Pacific gets blown to the coast effectively.”</p></li><li class="pmc-fallback-list-item-wrap lrv-u-margin-b-2" readability=-1.5><h2>How many feet were found in the Salish Sea?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Files_of_the_Unexplained_n_S1_E8_00_05_34_18.jpg><p>There have been at least 20 feet found around the Salish Sea since 2007.
