In honour of this special day - and to remind you not to take your mum for granted - we picked the brains of YP pet columnist, Dr Michael Bradley of Stanley Veterinary Clinic, to find out about some of the unusual ways some animal mothers treat their offspring.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>The duck-billed platypus is an odd creature: it looks like a mix between a guinea pig, duck and Wolverine. It is one of two mammals to lay eggs, like a bird, instead of giving birth.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Like other mammals, the babies are fed milk; but unlike other mammals, the mother doesn’t have nipples, so can’t suckle her young. Instead, the milk comes out of sweat-like glands and pools in grooves on her stomach, and then the young can lap it up.</span></p><p><h2 type=h2><span type=text>An unfair reputation?</span></h2></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Say the words “alligator” or “crocodile”, and most people imagine lean, green, eating machines. But in fact, when it comes to their young, the mothers of the species are quite attentive mothers, building nests for their young, and caring for them once they hatch. They’ll even carry the babies in mouth and take to water.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>But if you assume this means everything you’ve seen on TV is misleading, and assume girls like Pui Pui, the saltwater crocodile at Hong Kong Wetland Park “is equally loving to all creatures, including you”,&nbsp;says Bradley, who is part of the vet team that treats the local croc, “you’d be very, very wrong”. Don’t mess with them.</span></p><p><h2 type=h2><span type=text>Mummy? Mum? Muuummm?</span></h2></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Some people say there's a “maternal instinct”. It seems that cuckoos didn’t get that memo. The mother birds lay their eggs in the nest of another bird, usually of another species, and then leave the eggs. The “adoptive” mother doesn’t realise the baby cuckoo isn’t hers, and will feed it - even when that chick knocks her actual eggs or chicks out of the nest to ensure it gets more food.</span></p><p><h2 type=h2><span type=text>Paternity leave</span></h2></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>In a similarly unmaternal way, female seahorses lay the eggs, then leave the dad to it. Male seahorses are responsible for all parenting. The male keeps the eggs in a pouch until they hatch, then looks after them until they can care for themselves. Think of male seahorses as the stay-at-home dads of the animal kingdom.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Siamese fighting fish dads, too, are left holding the babies. A male fish build a nest out of air bubbles coated in saliva. After the female lays her eggs, he collects them in his mouth and place them in the nest to keep them safe from everything - including their mother, who is likely to eat them.</span></p><p><h2 type=h2><span type=text>Potty training</span></h2></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>It may seem as if it’s only exotic animal mums that exhibit strange behaviour; but in fact man’s best friend, and her mortal enemy have some odd habits, too.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph__StyledBlockElement-sc-4sxwoh-0 hVXIcN Body__StyledBodyParagraph-sc-1cgoct-1 UAQBx" type=p><span type=text>Young puppies and kittens won't pee or poo until their mother licks their bottoms. Then, when they do poo, she eats it, so that the nest stays clean and dry. Of course, this means that if you adopt a very young puppy or kitten and hand-rear it, you have to take the mother’s place. Luckily this doesn't mean licking or eating; you can encourage them to go by rubbing their bottoms with damp cotton wool.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kxrF7w6KqnKemmr9wuMifnKysqaGycLLEmquuqpWofKK%2B06KapZ1faH12gZBwaWisn6murbjYZq6eoaKZerW0yKeerGWRo7aurctmpK6lo2KxsA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
