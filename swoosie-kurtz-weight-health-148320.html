This time, fans of the show noticed the veteran actress was looking particularly thin — so thin, that she seemed to have lost weight from her already-slight build. Could it be that she’s dealing with some sort of health issue?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/swoosie-kurtz-weight-loss.jpg><p>Swoosie in 2007 vs. 2016.</p><p>Thankfully, all of the concern seems to be unwarranted, as the Sisters star hasn’t mentioned any sort of illness publicly. And if she was dealing with something, it’s likely she wouldn’t keep it private. After all, she’s been quite open in the past, even sharing experiences as personal as her past abortion. “It was very, very difficult for me,” she <a href=#>told Huffington Post in 2014</a>. “It was one of the most difficult things I’ve ever been through in my life. On all levels. Impossibly difficult.”</p><p>It’s also common for a senior woman like Swoosie to lose her appetite as she gets older, which may explain her smaller frame. In fact, ever since she entered this stage in her life, the actress has encountered speculation about her size. During her run on Mike & Molly a couple of years ago, fans were expressing their concern about her on Twitter, noting that she looked “sick.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Swoosie Kurtz just doesn’t look well on the Mike and Molly show. I really hope she’s not sick. She’s just skin & bones….not a good sign.</p><p>— Vote November 6th❣️ (@ILoveMySteelers) <a href=#>March 10, 2015</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I am worried about Swoosie Kurtz! Just watched Mike & Molly and she looks sick. I hope she’s alright. I’ll 🙏🏼 for her!</p><p>— 🇺🇸RhondaB🇺🇸 (@Burn1Lynn) <a href=#>May 20, 2016</a></p><p>She was fine then and she’s fine now. So now that we have that cleared up, we can focus our attention back on how much we appreciate having her on our screens. Keep the Swoosie roles coming!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46srqino56ybrfUq6uzZaeatqi002afnpmcqbVufZNxamtoXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
