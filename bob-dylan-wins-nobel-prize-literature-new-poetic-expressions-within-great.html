Songs such as Blowin’ in the Wind and The Times They Are A-Changin’ became anthems for the US anti-war and civil rights movements of the 1960s. His impact on popular culture was immense.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">Bob Dylan writes poetry for the ear.

The academy’s permanent secretary, Sara Danius, said while Dylan performs his poetry in the form of songs, that’s no different from the ancient Greeks, whose works were often performed to music.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Bob Dylan writes poetry for the ear,” she said. “But it’s perfectly fine to read his works as poetry.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Dylan is the first American winner of the Nobel literature prize since Toni Morrison in 1993.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Born on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota, Dylan grew up in a Jewish middle-class family.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">By his early 20s, he had taken the folk music world by storm. From that time on, he would constantly reinvent himself – often enraging followers in the process – but then later winning them back and adding new admirers. His career was such a complicated pastiche of elusive, ever-changing styles that it took six actors to portray him in the 2007 movie based on his life, I’m Not There.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Although generally described as a rock musician, Dylan has been influenced by numerous musical styles, including country, gospel, blues, folk, pop, and rhythm and blues. Pursuing them all, sometimes separately and other times simultaneously, he remains a towering influence over music and popular culture.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He won an Academy Award in 2001 for the song Things Have Changed and received a lifetime achievement award from the Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences in 1991. In 2008, he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for his contributions to music and American culture.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Dylan honoured with literature award</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2d9c4OXbGpomp%2BXeqXFy5qlZq%2BZo8Buus6bnKVloKe2u7GMpaCtnaKWwba%2BxGalnq9dpbymwMicZJ6woKeytL%2FIqKWsZaeewam1zWaeq52RqQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
