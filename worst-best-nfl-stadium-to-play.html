The Athletic’s beat writers surveyed 85 players over the past month to get their takes on that topic and others.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Arrowhead Stadium — home of the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=46 href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> — had the highest percentage of players (17.9 percent) vote it as the best <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2 href=#>NFL</a> stadium among the 84 players who responded to the question. The Minnesota Vikings’ U.S. Bank Stadium (13.7 percent), the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=59 href=#>Los Angeles Rams</a> and Chargers’ SoFi Stadium (8.9 percent), the Green Bay Packers’ Lambeau Field and the Seattle Seahawks’ Lumen Field (both 8.3 percent) followed in the rankings for best stadium.</p><p>“That place is electric,” one player said about Arrowhead. “That’s one of the coolest places to play. In my opinion, the loudest in the NFL.”</p><p>The venue has hosted five straight AFC Championship Games and is the <a href=#>NFL’s</a> third-oldest stadium, opening in 1972.</p><p>U.S. Bank Stadium — a seven-year-old venue — was also lauded by players despite being an indoor stadium with turf.</p><p>“That place was f—ing loud,” a player said.</p><p>One player commented on Lambeau Field: “The fans and the atmosphere are the best in the league.”</p><p>A player who chose Seattle’s Lumen Field said, “If it was grass — whoo! — it would be perfect,” while another added: “It almost feels like you’re in a bird’s nest. Gotham City.”</p><p>Players also sounded off on the league’s worst venues to play in, with the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=52 href=#>New York Jets</a> and Giants’ MetLife Stadium outranking the others (18.4 percent) in that category. The Washington Commanders’ FedEx Field (13.9 percent) and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=34 href=#>Buffalo</a> Bills’ Highmark Stadium (12.7 percent) were the other top vote-getters for the worst stadium to play in.</p><p>Regarding MetLife Stadium, a player said that the “turf sucks and the whole place is lame.” Another agreed about the turf, adding that the “fans are horrible. Everything about that place is horrible.”</p><p>Discussing FedEx Field, which <a href=#>didn’t have sufficient water pressure</a> for players to take showers Sunday, one player said: “Almost everything about (FedEx) is below the standard of what an NFL stadium should be.”</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“The place is just a dump,” said another.</p><p>Although Lambeau Field was among the top five for the best stadium, it also was in the top five for the worst stadium (7.6 percent): “F—ing Green Bay, because it’s super cold!”</p><p>Additionally, the Oakland Coliseum — which hasn’t been used since the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=53 href=#>Raiders</a> moved to Las Vegas in 2020 — still managed to pick up a couple of votes (2.5 percent).</p><p>Each player polled was asked the same set of questions, although not every player answered them all. They were granted anonymity to candidly offer their opinions on some of the league’s biggest topics.</p><h2>Required reading</h2><p>(Photo: Kara Durrette / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGlucHFmanxzfJFsZmppX2d%2BcMPOq6qtZZKawLV5zZ%2BjZquklrGqwcxmq6hloKGuuns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
