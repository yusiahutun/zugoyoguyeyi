‘I remember the Man City game here,’ recalled Joe Gomez, glancing over his shoulder across Anfield.
‘We were 4-1 up with about five minutes to go and won 4-3.

That is what we need if we are going to challenge for the title.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>As a kid in Catford, south London, Gomez used to take the 160 bus to training at Charlton’s academy.

Largely because that was where he met his girlfriend, Tamara.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I didn’t have much chat, I was quite quiet,’ he said, bashfully. ‘But it was all about Blackberry messenger back then. I started messaging and talking and we got to know each other.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This is important because if it wasn’t for Tamara, Gomez might not have coped in his early days at Liverpool. We sometimes make the mistake of presuming that wealth and a degree of fame make footballers immune to the stresses that affect other young people, but they don’t and Gomez learned this quickly.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Only just 18 when Brendan Rodgers signed him, Gomez went from the security of his family home — three sisters and one brother — to an apartment on his own in Liverpool’s Sefton Park.</p><img id=i-2476514eaf0e81de src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/20/5455420-6321955-image-a-51_1540581446631.jpg height=452 width=634 alt="Only 18 when he joined Reds, he went from security of family home to an apartment on his own" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Only 18 when he joined Reds, he went from security of family home to an apartment on his own</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We just packed my car and drove up,’ he recalled. ‘Tamara stayed the first night but was at university in London.

I am very much a boring guy anyway. The lads here give me stick for that. So I just went home, thought about stuff and did nothing.

You know what you are doing it all for.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘But it was hard at times, those first two years, I won’t lie.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>What Gomez doesn’t mention is the cruciate ligament injury he suffered playing for England Under 21s only seven games into his Liverpool career. He didn’t play at all between October 2015 and January 2017. Life in that apartment must have been lonely.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I won’t dwell on the injury as it’s behind me but back then the only release for me was when I was on the pitch or training,’ he said.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘And when that is replaced by the physio room then it gets even harder.’&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gomez is religious and was offered help and support by Liverpool’s club chaplain Bill Bygroves. ‘He always offered for me to go round to his house and helped with the transition,’ he said.</p><img id=i-9f4a52f84c659d42 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/20/5455426-6321955-image-a-53_1540581484293.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="&nbsp;Gomez is religious and was offered help and support by Liverpool’s club chaplain Bill Bygroves" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>&nbsp;Gomez is religious and was offered help and support by Liverpool’s club chaplain Bill Bygroves</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘This club does little things like that really well.

Not that the sports science team would allow it!</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I think over the first 10 yards me and Virgil would be looking at Sadio and Mo’s backs. But we may claw some back towards the end.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The young Gomez was always fast but was gangly, too, and a little uncoordinated. Having failed his first Charlton trial at the age of 10, he was soon in the system and usually playing in age group teams with boys much older.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Liverpool, encouraged by chief scout Barry Hunter, wanted to sign him when he was 16 — 18 months before he made his first team debut for Charlton.</p><img id=i-f3592c236f0104c9 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/20/5455758-6321955-image-a-55_1540581567901.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="Defender&nbsp;Gomez has worked hard at his football and his mental approach to the game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Defender&nbsp;Gomez has worked hard at his football and his mental approach to the game</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But his father, Gus, and long-term agent, John Morris, felt it was too soon.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At that point, Liverpool had already identified Gomez as a central defender.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hunter and his staff were further convinced of this when they watched him battling big Cardiff striker Kenwyne Jones in a Championship game when he was only 17. But, developed by Charlton’s experienced academy heads Steve Avory and Paul Hart, the teenager was initially held back by his dislike of heading the ball.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Hart was a centre half for Brian Clough at Nottingham Forest and later brought England defender Jonathan Woodgate through the youth system at Leeds.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘He threatened to not let me play until I sorted the heading,’ said Gomez. ‘If it wasn’t for him I may not be here.

Now I thrive on it. Back then I wasn’t how a proper defender should be.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Gomez has worked hard at his football and his mental approach to the game. At Charlton, he was introspective if he made a mistake, even in training.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It affected me more than it should have,’ he nodded. ‘I would like to say I have the balance now but every mistake tests you, doesn’t it?’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Physically, the young defender has grown into his frame to the extent that Klopp instructed him to actually try and lose some muscle. ‘He called it my beach body,’ said Gomez, laughing at the memory.</p><img id=i-c538b197b3206e7f src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2018/10/26/20/5455390-6321955-image-a-60_1540581646690.jpg height=461 width=634 alt="With a whole summer off this year, Gomez spent precisely one week away from training ground" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>With a whole summer off this year, Gomez spent precisely one week away from training ground</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>An ankle injury last spring required surgery and cost Gomez a place in the Champions League final and England’s World Cup squad.

It needs to come.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the 1978-79 season, Bob Paisley’s Liverpool won the old First Division title by conceding 16 goals over a 42-game season. In 21 games at home, Liverpool scored 51 times and conceded only four. Can that ever happen again?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I don’t know,’ replied Gomez, blowing out his cheeks. ‘In a league with this level of competition it’s probably far-fetched — 16 is ambitious and it’s still early. But we should definitely aspire to be renowned for defending, as well as attacking.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The front three here has one of the best reputations in the world.
