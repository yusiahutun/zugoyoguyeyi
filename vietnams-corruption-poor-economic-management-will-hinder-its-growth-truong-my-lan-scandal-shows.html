But there were no legal consequences for Lan, probably due to her political connections. So it’s little surprise that 12 years later, the same bank, owned by the same person, repeated the fraud, just at a much larger scale.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Vietnam has been a darling of foreign investors, with US$22 billion and US$25 billion pledged in 2022 and 2023, respectively. But the case of Lan and VTP/SCB should serve as a reminder that Vietnam’s endemic corruption and unwillingness to address fundamental problems in the banking system and improve its economic management will hinder its growth.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Untangling Lan’s shady corporate web</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lan, now 67, started out as a hair-accessories trader in a market in Ho Chi Minh City’s District 5 before moving into real estate in 1992, allegedly thanks to her political connections. Within a few years, she was able to secure some of the most valuable properties in the city, including several on Nguyen Hue Boulevard, one of the most expensive streets in Asia. She cultivated political support by being a generous sponsor to major city initiatives.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the heart of her business were SCB, several property firms and investment funds. But a year after her arrest police are still untangling her corporate web, which included more than 1,000 companies, mostly shells, created to secure bank loans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The growth of Lan’s business empire was fuelled by taking on large amounts of debt through the commercial bond market. Her businesses issued 25 different tranches of bonds that were aggressively sold through SCB, raising 30 trillion dong.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But most of her capital was raised through bank borrowing. Lan allegedly controlled 91 per cent of SCB, through 27 nominees, and between February 2018 and October last year, 93 per cent of its loans were directed to VTP and its shell companies without collateral, repayment schedules, or normal due diligence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/12/01/55cde4e9-79c4-467d-aa64-4e2c482077b1_87eb9b66.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lan got away with it by bribing a senior regulator at the central bank and 23 other state regulators with US$5.2 million to falsify their oversight reports of SCB and hide bad debts and evidence of wrongdoing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Lan was never formally linked to SCB, her arrest immediately prompted a bank run. The central bank quickly intervened and promised to guarantee deposits, assuring the public that it was undertaking the “necessary measures” and putting the bank under “special control” to ensure that SCB remained liquid and able to continue normal operations. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Public Security cracked down on any social-media posts about the bank’s solvency, arresting several people as a deterrent to others.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In all, prosecutors intend to file charges against 86 people. Lan’s husband remains at large, liquidating assets. Two suspects died while in police custody, and another died by suicide. In October 2023, the Ministry of Public Security issued arrest warrants for seven SCB executives, including two former chairmen.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">An abject failure of oversight</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The scale of the VTP fraud is just breathtaking. So what does this case say about Vietnam’s economic management?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">First, Vietnamese regulators have proven to be overwhelmed by the economy’s growth. The ease of establishing shell corporations, the culture of complex cross-ownership, and the lack of due diligence, led to US$12.5 billion in embezzlement at one bank alone.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This was an abject failure of oversight. One year after Lan’s arrest, no senior leader in the government or central bank has lost their job over the VTP/SCB scandal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Second, the banking system remains fragile. Like VTP/SCB, many of the local conglomerates – most of which are heavily invested in real estate – have affiliated banks in the ecosystem to leverage capital, so any further collapses would entail bank runs. And due to Lan and the real-estate bubble, the government has tightened the commercial bond market.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">If regulators were on the take from Lan, why should we expect anything else from the other 40 financial institutions in the country?</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the case of SCB, the central bank was able to step in and guarantee deposits, but it’s not clear that it would have the resources or acumen to respond to multiple simultaneous bank runs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The central bank recently put forward for government approval a restructuring plan for SCB, and in September appointed a new chairman. Yet the bank remains saddled with VTP’s non-performing loans.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Following a banking crisis in the early 2010s, the government in 2013 established the Vietnam Asset Management Company (VAMC) to purchase non-performing loans from banks, to shore up their balance sheets.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But to put this into perspective, by 2019, VAMC only had around US$1 billion in cash and bonds to buy up bad debts. And non-performing loans are increasing. A recent report by the State Inspection Commission showed a 52 per cent increase in bad debts at 28 banks in the third quarter of this year. Unless VAMC gets a significant injection of capital, it could be overwhelmed.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Innovation is everything’: what fast-growing Vietnam is learning from China</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Third, corruption remains endemic. This was evident at two levels. The corruption involving the central bank personnel and other government regulators raises significant questions about the capacity and integrity of regulators who were paid to cover up the portfolio of bad debts and evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Every one of the 24 regulators who were responsible for overseeing SCB was on the take. If regulators were on the take from Lan, why should we expect anything else from the other 40 financial institutions in the country?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">SCB’s establishment in 2011 should have itself raised eyebrows among regulators, as all three of its constituent banks had chequered management, large amounts of non-performing loans, and had seen bank runs. Yet regulators overlooked all the red flags as well as Lan’s hidden ownership.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Finally, authorities are still unwilling to provide an answer to how Lan acquired secure access to 156 properties, including some in Ho Chi Minh City’s most high-end district. All land is owned by the state and, thus, requires political connections.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lan had been under suspicion for at least five years, but was never arrested until 2022. There’s been no official explanation as to why, but there’s plenty of suspicion that she had too much information on politicians involving shady businesses, taking advantage of Vietnam’s booming real-estate sector.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That is where the investigation has stopped.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Zachary Abuza is a professor at the National War College in Washington, DC, where he focuses on Southeast Asian politics and security issues.
