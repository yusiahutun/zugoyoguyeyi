Her testimony chronicled the actions former President Trump took on the day of the violent Capitol attack.</p><p>She served as an aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. She testified that Trump had wanted the Ellipse to be fully packed with supporters for his speech on Jan. 6. Some of them watching from a distance in order to avoid going through metal detectors and surrendering their weapons hampered that.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Cassidy Hutchinson?</strong></h3><p>On 28 June 2022, Cassidy Hutchinson also testified to Trump’s reaction to his limousine on January 6. She testified that Tony Ornato, then-White House deputy chief of staff for operations, relayed to her later that day that the former president became enraged when Secret Service refused to take him to the Capitol and instead insisted that they return to the White House.</p><p>Cassidy added that Ornato told her that Trump had attempted to grab the wheel of the vehicle and then to grab the agent himself.</p><p>The testimony indicated that Trump was aware that the crowds were armed. He then instructed these armed crowd to march to the Capitol to “fight like hell” against certifying the 2020 election results. She also quoted her former boss saying that Trump “doesn’t want to do anything” about calls for violence against then-Vice President Mike Pence.</p><p>She recalled Mark saying, “He thinks Mike deserves it”.</p><p>People were divided after Cassidy Hutchinson’s testimony.</p><p>David French, an editor for The Dispatch, praised Cassidy for “the most extraordinary congressional testimony I’ve ever seen”. He wrote, “Hutchinson’s sworn testimony closes a gap in the criminal case against Trump, and Trump is closer to a credible prosecution than ever before”.</p><p>Trump in response to Cassidy’s testimony said that he “hardly know[s]” her. He made negative remarks against her saying her “a total phony and ‘leaker'”. He added that he “didn’t want or request that we make room for people with guns to watch my speech” and called her testimony “fake” and “sick”.</p><p>In addition, Cassidy has also become the target of online conspiracy theorist “Q” who posed absurd and illogical questions against Cassidy Hutchinson and her testimony regarding the January 6 Capitol Hill Riot.</p><h3><strong>Is Cassidy Hutchinson Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>Ever since the testimony January 6 testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson, everybody is interested to learn more about her life beyond what meets the eye.

One follower commented on Richard’s post and asked, “Single? You could be my father-in-law!”</p><p>Richard, as a response, wrote to him in the comment, “she is married with 12 children;))))) SORRY”.</p><p>So, we could see that men do craving her attention, even on her father’s social media.
