Many of you already know but for my friends that still don't, we got engaged at the end of last year... and we've got a baby hatching early summer."</p><p id=e9LmnYH-SjY data-wc=57>Shortly afterwards, she was pictured wearing a dazzling engagement ring on her left hand. <a class=hm-link href=#>Experts told the Express</a> that the three-carat central emerald stone looks as though it has had no treatment, making it more valuable. While it is estimated to be worth £30,000, it also has sentimental value as it is reportedly a Johnson family heirloom.&nbsp;</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=e1iQY6BQlqw data-wc=58>However, this could be a risky choice for an engagement ring, which tends to be worn every day. While diamonds are notoriously hard-wearing, making them perfect choices for engagement rings, emeralds are softer and can be susceptible to chips and scratches – a worrying prospect, especially if Carrie hopes to pass on the heirloom to her own children.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Carrie Johnson's London flat before meeting Boris is so different from £3.8m moated mansion" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f890a225f693-boris-johnson-and-wife-carrie-symonds-d.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Carrie Johnson's London flat before meeting Boris is so different from £3.8m moated mansion" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Carrie Johnson's London flat before meeting Boris is so different from £3.8m moated mansion</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Why Princess Eugenie's engagement ring from Jack Brooksbank is so rare" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/84089130d76d-eugenie-engagement-ring.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Why Princess Eugenie's engagement ring from Jack Brooksbank is so rare" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Why Princess Eugenie's engagement ring from Jack Brooksbank is so rare</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eOZRifIlOO5 data-wc=32>Boris and Carrie are parents to son Wilfred, who was born on 29 April 2020, daughter Romy, who was born in December 2021, and baby Frank, whom they welcomed in July 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/901094d3d25e-boris-johnson-carrie-g7.jpg><p id=eLapHshVLKO data-wc=28>Boris is also a father to four children with his second wife, Barrister Marina Wheeler: Lara Lettice, 30, Milo Arthur, 28, Cassia Peaches, 26, and Theodore Apollo, 24.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bda2917b5d5c-carrie-johnson-pregnancy-announcement.jpg><p id=eJBfSt3_m0i data-wc=18>The couple got married in May 2021 in a secret ceremony at Westminster Cathedral amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p id=e9bxRwSvv_u data-wc=48>The bride was a vision in a cost £2,830 white <a class=hm-link href=#>bohemian lace wedding dress</a> by Christos Costarellos which she had rented from MyWardrobe HQ.
