They are a child of <strong>Robert Paine</strong> and <strong>Laura Lundy</strong>, born in 1994. Both Robert and Laura are the devoted Christians. In addition, they have contributed extensively to the TV and film industry, and that’s where Brigette got their influence.</p><p>Brigette is famous for their role in the 2017 hit series <a href=#><strong>Atypical</strong></a>. Furthermore, they have voiced for many social causes and strongly supported the <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> movement.</p><p>This blog discusses Brigette Lundy Paine’s gender, age, sexuality, and other wiki facts.</p><h2>Brigette Lundy Sexuality & Gender</h2><p>Brigette is a <a href=#>non-binary</a>. From an early age, Brigette felt as if they were not a girl. What’s surprising is usually when people aren’t feeling like their designated gender; they feel like the opposite one. However, in Brigette’s case, they did not feel like either. And that’s where the term or gender ‘non-binary’ kicks in.</p><p>The term Binary represents two genders of the Homo sapiens, i.e., male and female. Now, the non-binary folks don’t fall in either category. You might think that they are transgender as they do not accept the gender they are assigned to. However, many non-binary people do not want themselves to be characterized as transgender either.</p><p>Some non-binary people like to consider themselves genderless, and some think they have two or more genders. Furthermore, some believe that they have an inexplicable gender. Brigette does not know what they are except for the fact that they are non-binary. They felt somewhat male, somewhat female, and a little bit of both. As a result, they took up the pronoun they/them instead of him/her. &nbsp;To date, they participated in many gender activities. Moreover, they also supported the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><h2>Age</h2><p>Brigette was born in <strong>1994</strong>, and they observe their birthday on the <strong>10th of August</strong> every year. The non-binary TV actor turns 27 in August 2021.</p><h2>Height and Measurement</h2><p>Brigette has a stunning body and a powerful personality. Maybe that is why many series have featured them to date. According to our reports, they have a curvy 33-23-34 body. Furthermore, they are <strong>5’8” tall</strong> and weigh about <strong>61 kilograms</strong>. However, these are just approximations as the physical parameters keep changing. We’ll update the blog upon receiving additional information in the coming days.</p><h2>Dating and Partner</h2><p>Brigette discovered in 2019 that they were non-binary. However, the actor was in a relationship before the realization. They got into a relationship with the celeb Joshua Hoover in 2017. It was a perfectly normal relationship, and by that, we mean involving no gender complications. The actor Joshua Hoover tweeted about the relationship back in 2017. Furthermore, we also have information that they exchanged engagement rings.</p><p>In an interview in 2020, the non-binary personality mentioned that they have a partner. However, they do not specify a name.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-2660 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famous-celebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Brigette-Lundy-Pain-Joshua-Hoover.jpg alt="Brigette Lundy with his Ex-boyfriend, Joshnu Hoover" width=587 height=509 sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-2660 class=wp-caption-text>An American actress and a non-binary personality, Brigette Lundy with their Ex-boyfriend, Joshua Hoover.</p><h2>Early Life</h2><p>Brigette Lundy was born in Texas. But their family shifted to California when Brigette was just two years old. Brigette attended Encinal High school. They loved cheerleading and acting in the high school’s club. Furthermore, Brigette graduated from High school in 2012 and completed their University studies in 2015. For that matter, Brigette attended the NewYork University.</p><h2>Parents and Family</h2><p>Brigette is the non-binary child of <strong>Robert Paine</strong> and <strong>Laura Lundy</strong>. Their parents raised them in California as their beloved daughter. Robert and Laura have been in the acting industry for a long time now. The couple has led a successful career in acting and directing shows.</p><p>When Brigette starred for the hit comedy series <strong>Atypical</strong>, they showed some hints of being non-binary. The show pointed out time and again that it is okay to be queer. Furthermore, it also featured some queer couples. Brigette explained to their mom that they are non-binary, taking reference to the show. It was only after the disclosure to their mom that they made the revelation public.</p><p>Furthermore, they also welcomed and supported other non-binary members through their posts. To date, they have been involved in many social activities and speak out their opinion loud and clear in front of their million followers.</p><h2>Movies & TV Shows</h2><p>The most notable screen for Brigette has to be the <strong>Atypical</strong> series. It aired in 2017, where they played the role of ‘Casey Gardner.’ The viewers have also commended the series on the grounds that it represented the voices of the Trans genders. Maybe that’s where the actor found their realization of them being non-binary. Furthermore, Brigette started their acting career in early 2015. They were already familiar with the industry as both of their parents were actors and directors. &nbsp;<strong>One Bad Choice</strong>&nbsp;is their first screen performance.</p><p>Moreover, Brigette featured in some popular titles like <strong>The Downsizing</strong>, and <strong>Glass Castle</strong>.
