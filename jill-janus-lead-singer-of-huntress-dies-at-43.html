(CelebrityAccess) — Jill Janus, the vocalist of the California-based heavy metal band Huntress, died on August 14th after committing suicide. She was 43.</p><p>Janus’ death was confirmed by a statement from her publicist: “It is with a heavy heart that we announce that Jill Janus–frontwoman for the California heavy metal band Huntress–passed away on Tuesday, August 14. A long-time sufferer of mental illness, she took her own life outside of Portland, Oregon. Janus spoke publicly about these challenges in hopes of guiding others to address and overcome their mental illness.”</p><p>Janus founded Huntress in 2009 and they released their first EP “Off with Her Head” in 2010. The following year, the band was signed by Napalm Records and they released their followup EP, as well as three studio albums, “Spell Eater”, “Starbound Beast”, and “Static.”</p><p>In 2015, Janus posted to the band’s Facebook page that Huntress would wind up but that she planned to continue to make music. The post was later removed and&nbsp;guitarist Blake Meahl stated that the band would continue to make music, and that Janus’s post was due to her mental illness.</p><p>The future status of the band is unknown.</p><p>Janus was also involved with numerous side projects, including working as vocalist for female metal/hard rock cover bands TheStarbreakers and Chelsea Girls.</p><p>In addition, Janus was co-composer and creator of an upcoming rock opera with Trans-Siberian Orchestra’s Angus Clark and had a decade-long career as NYC-based DJ Penelope Tuesdae.</p><p>No information was available at press time regarding her survivors or a memorial service.</p><p>If you or someone you know might be at risk of suicide, Call 1-800-273-8255 to reach the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
