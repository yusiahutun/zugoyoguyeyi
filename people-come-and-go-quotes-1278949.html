But not everyone we meet stays in touch with us forever — such is life. We meet so many people, some become our friends, some colleagues, and a few become like a family member to us. However, sooner or later, the hustle and bustle of our lives make us realize that not everyone will be on our journey till the end. It’s the bitter truth of life — and with our list of “people come and go quotes”, you’ll be reminded that everything in life is temporary and that beauty lies within staying happy in the moment. Hence, if you’ve lost touch with someone you truly cared about due to any reason, don’t take it personally.&nbsp;</p><p>In most cases, people who deeply love and care for each other don’t intentionally mean to walk away from each other, but life’s uncertainties and responsibilities might make people do so. But remember that those you love would never do that with all their heart. As the famous adage goes, “Life goes on”, hence people go and come in your life and it’s an experience that can make people strong mentally and emotionally.

Some people might become so close to us that it could be hard to let them go. But just like everything else in this world, the existence of a person in our life is also not permanent. We come across different people from all walks of life and they might become so important to us that it could be different to let them go.&nbsp;</p><p>They strike a chord in our hearts, making us emotionally vulnerable when it comes to detaching ourselves from them. But as said above, in the various aspects of life, we meet all types of friends and not everyone is meant to be on the journey of life forever. We hope our list of the “people come and go quotes” gives you a different purpose in life, helping you understand that even though, in every phase of life, we need friends and family, in the end, we are on our own. People might come and go, and some even stay with us forever, but the only person you’re always going to be with is you! So stay positive and happy always!</p><p class=also_read_style><strong>ALSO READ:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# onclick='triggerCommentfollowAlsoClick("article_also_read_click","60 People Come And Go Quotes That Show That Life Goes on",1278949,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/relationships/hug-quotes-1265070","articlepage","/lifestyle/relationships/people-come-and-go-quotes-1278949","Content Also read","lifestyle","relationships"),triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","60 People Come And Go Quotes That Show That Life Goes on",1278949,"https://www.pinkvilla.com/lifestyle/relationships/hug-quotes-1265070","articlepage","/lifestyle/relationships/people-come-and-go-quotes-1278949","151 Hug Quotes That’ll Remind You of Life’s Simple Pleasures","Also_Read","lifestyle","relationships")'><strong>151 Hug Quotes That’ll Remind You of Life’s Simple Pleasures</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGijop6VqMG6uMRoqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpq1%2BlsrC8y55knKedmnqiusNmnqhloaq8tbHSZmhrb2hugXo%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
