"We wanted to show that guide dogs can play many roles in human lives," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The team also incorporated Cruella De Vil, the dog-fur-wearing villain in the Disney classic , as well as 's slinky dog and green army men into their entourage. Their film-camera sedan earned them the Best-Decorated Chair award.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The sedan race also saw more than 20 organ transplant recipients take part, turning up dressed as Superman.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Chan Kwok-ming, leader of the team from the Transplant Sports Association, took part in his first sedan race after his kidney transplant three years ago. "I feel so much better after the transplant," said the 50-year-old sports lover who completed a full marathon this year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Martin Wong Yim-wah, the association's founding chairman, said they hoped to promote awareness of organ donation. "Our Superman outfits remind the others that they, too, can be a hero when they take part in organ donation," he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And while the yellow umbrella has become a popular symbol in Hong Kong because of the ongoing Occupy Central democracy movement, it made no appearance among the crowd of painstakingly decorated sedans in the race.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Eris Lau Ching, director of the Sedan Chair Charities Fund that organised the race, said she was not surprised. "As our event is for charities, we do not wish to get involved in politics. Most of our participants are expatriates, and the extent to which they are involved in local current affairs is not as large as that of the locals."</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Pharaohs rule in the sedan chair dress stakes</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZomKusmZi5pnuQb2lua2VqfKS7y6isq56loXqxtMCrmKigo2K%2FtrjEZpinpqWWuW6%2FxJ2Yp2WTna6qvoyrmJydXaWyorc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
